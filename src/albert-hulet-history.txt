                      THE LIFE STORY OF

                    ALBERT FRANKLIN HULET


     On September the 5th, 1895, I took my first peep into this world and found a glad welcome awaiting me. I was the ninth child and the fifth son born to Sylvester Silas and Mary Elizabeth Dalley Hulet. A brother, Oscar, born two years before, had died at the age of one year so I was considered a sort of replacement and brought a little extra cheer to the Hulet family.

     My memory of the first two years of my life is rather vague.  However, I have been told, and it is firmly established by documentary evidence, that I was born in Summit, Iron County, Utah; a small hamlet between Cedar City and Parowan, settled principally by Hulets and Dalleys.

     The children born to my parents in order of their birth were: Sylvester Silas, Mary, Emma, Katie, Lenora May, Marion Cyrus, Francis Edgar, Oscar Philip, Albert Franklin and Leonard Merrill.

	When Sylvester (Vettie) was five years old a terrible tragedy and sorrow came to the family.  He had gone to the granary for some feed for his rabbits and while climbing into the bin had slipped and fallen, catching his head between two boards, where his little body was found about two hours later by Mother, who, when he failed to answer her call, had come to look for him.

	When I was nine months old, our family left Summit for greener pastures.  After a month of travel, driving the teams and loose livestock, we arrived in Teton Valley and stopped on the east side of the valley on the border of Wyoming at a place called Alta, near the mouth of Teton Canyon.  Our first winter was spent at the home of one of Mother's sisters, Ann Pratt.  As Aunt Ann had a rather large family and the log house was comparatively small, it took real pioneer ingenuity and courage to survive when our family of nine was added to it.

	That year my father bought the homestead claim of George Goodrich, located about a mile south of the Pratt place on what was called Spring Creek.  While we found green pastures, they were not green for long, as for six long months they were covered with a cold white substance called snow.  Our family was not used to such severe winters and failed to secure sufficient feed for the stock.  When hay ran out they were forced to feed what straw they could buy.  Consequently many of the cattle died, leaving the family hard-pressed for sufficient income to live on.

	Father went back to Utah to work during the winter, leaving Mother and the girls and Marion and Francis to haul the wood and feed the livestock.  It was a real struggle for survival.  Although Mother weighed scarcely a hundred pounds, a more valiant soul never lived.

	Father had two families.  The second family consisted of Aunt Sarah, Mother's half sister, and their children, Sarah Pearl (Sadie), Moses Arthur (Mody), David Willard, Lettie and Lillian. Aunt Sarah's family, after a brief stay in Wyoming, returned to Utah.

	Our home was about two miles from school and church, but in spite of the rigors of winter or lack of proper clothing, the children succeeded in obtaining the fundamentals of an education and never lacked for spiritual training.

	Among my earliest recollections is an old two-room log house, rather sagging in the back where some of the logs had rotted and settled, covered on the inside with factory and papered with copies of the "Deseret Semi-Weekly News" to keep out the drafts.  The ceiling was low and badly spotted and stained where the rains or melted snow had leaked through the dirt roof.

     I was nearly four years old when my dresses were handed down to my younger brother, Leonard, and I was given a brand new pair of pants Mother had made for me.  How happy I was.  I was a girl no longer.  I began to forsake my rag doll and venture around the yard on a gentle, yet high-spirited stick-horse. 

	We seldom had visitors, so I had not learned very well the ways of society.  Whenever a neighbor happened by and gave me the usual salutation my answer invariably was, "My Pa Plow".  It was a little difficult to understand or appreciate until they knew me better since I gave the same reply summer or winter.

	We didn't have many toys or playthings from the store, but this didn't bother us nor detour us in our play.  We used what nature provided, and with good imagination.  No boys had more fun nor played harder than we did.  Rocks of various sizes and colors, of which there were plenty as well as a good variety, were our cows and sheep; sticks for horses as they were easier to ride, and sardine cans for wagons and buggies.  We would go through the cycle of rags to riches several times a year.  It was no fun being rich.  All the pleasure came in the effort to become rich.  Thus we spent many long summer days of childhood.

	Autumn days also brought their pleasures.  The big threshing machines would come with the horse power with its many horses or the steam engine with its whistle; lots of men rushing here and there, pitching bundles or hauling grain to the bin with the horses on the run--all so exciting.  Then there were the great piles of food which we only saw at threshing time.

	One day, Clement Dalley and I rode old Roaney down to Sam Sheet's place to see the thresher and the steam engine.  The men hauling grain "high-jacked" us into the granary to shovel the grain back against the wall so they could dump the sacks.  I had a scoop larger than I was and Clement a trowel.  We worked for a little while.  When we saw a little pause between wagons we climbed out of the bin, got on our horse and took off for home without ever seeing the thresher.  		     			
			
	Those days soon passed and we found ourselves weeding gardens, driving the derrick horse during the haying season; hunting the cows in the evenings--listening for the cow-bell while the cows would let the flies bite until they brought the tears rather than move so the bell could ring.  It often seemed like a contest between us.  Sometimes the cows won out and we came home without them so we would try it again in the morning.	
			
	We picked potatoes in the fall and helped get in the supply of wood so we could spend our winter evenings after school sawing it into blocks to fit the hungry, pot-bellied stove which had no respect for growing boys.	

	I remember standing by the window one winter evening when I was very small, watching Mother and the older brothers and sisters doing chores, cutting wood, milking cows and feeding the livestock when a great boar pig, belonging to Uncle Rob Dalley, came through the yard.  Mother tried to drive him away when he turned on her, knocking her down and slicing her leg with his huge tusks, cutting a gash about six inches long just above her knee.  With no doctor such a wound would have perhaps proven fatal today, but Mother could cure most anything.  In a month or two the wound was healed and the pig run through the sausage grinder.     				

	When I was nine years old I was stopped in my play with a severe headache and high temperature.  There was no doctor in the valley, but a trained nurse who happened by came in to see me and called it typhoid fever.  I was in bed for six weeks and only through faith and the power of the priesthood, which was continually exercised in my behalf, was I able to throw off the disease.  Many times during the nights when the fever was at its height, my father was called from his bed to administer to me.  I never failed to receive relief.  After about three months, I was fully recovered and have had no ill effects from the disease.	

	My schooling was rather hit and miss, mostly miss.  I began by attending a summer kindergarten school when I was five years old.  It was conducted by Mrs. Held.  I had to walk the two miles to and from school, but didn't mind it much--I was used to it.

	The following winter, J. Roy Fairbanks taught the eight grades.  I was enrolled in the first grade.  After about two months I fell off a horse when Emma was bringing me home and sprained my arm so badly I was unable to attend school until half the season was over.  However, with the help of Mother and sisters I passed on to the second grade with the rest of the class.

	We boys spent much of our spare time during the summer months trapping ground squirrels, or "chislers" as we called them.  They were very numerous and caused a considerable damage to gardens and field crops.  At times we were paid as high as one cent apiece for the tails, when Father felt a little prosperous.  This trapping carried over into the winter months when we were older, when we would try for the Wiley Coyote.  Their tails brought as much as two or three dollars if attached to a well-furred skin.  We didn't make great inroads into the coyote bands.  Catching one now and then didn't seem to affect the quantity or quality of their howls, which we heard most of every winter night.  At times it sounded as though the foothills were full of the slinking marauders who would come to the very doors of our outbuildings to catch the early birds or hens, when they came out for the morning worm.  The old family dog would bark as long as he had a squeak left in his voice, but the cunning thieves seemed to have heard that a "barking dog never bites" so waited patiently for the hen.  

	I was always intrigued with Indians and Indian lore.  So instead of "cops and robbers" it was "Indians and whites".  I usually chose to be the Indian.  We made our own bows and arrows-usually from kooks or serviceberry bushes, with rose bush sticks for arrows, and a piece of baling wire hammered flat on the end for the head.  I learned to shoot pretty well for so young a "buck", as my cousin Milton Dalley learned during one of our Indian raids.  As he appeared around the corner of the barn I hurriedly aimed and shot from a distance of fifty or seventy-five yards and hit him in the wrist as he threw it up to protect his chest.  It was a bloody battle.  Our warfare was somewhat modified after that.  Then, too, as I shot a departing hen in her most exposed part she ran off into the brush with my best arrow.

	We spent a lot of time with our cousins, the Dalleys--Milton, Lowell, Claud and Clement. Spending the night at their home or having one of them stay overnight with us was a real treat.  We passed many happy hours together, fishing, hunting, swimming, or just visiting or playing games.

	When I was about eight years old, my father bought his first band of sheep.  It was a small herd to start with, but he added to it regularly for a few years until he had several hundred head. This was when the real trials of life began.  We had to herd them in the foothills or in the fields near home.  I had spent some time a year or two before herding pigs until I fell off the back of one which I was riding to the pasture and hurt my arm so badly I was deprived of this great pleasure.  I couldn't ride the sheep, but had to follow them all day or battle with them to keep them from the grain or alfalfa fields.         	
					
	One day while I was alone in the field with the sheep a neighbor's dog came bothering.  I had old Sharp, our dog, with me.  The dog tried to pick a fight with Sharp with me right in the middle.  I ran to get away but the other dog decided I was in the way and jumped onto me, chewing my shoulder and arm.  Sharp was on the job and grabbed the stray by the neck, threw him down and soon had him howling for mercy.  I was always afraid of dogs after that.  A two-pound dog could run me up a tree.

	Every day I spent with the sheep I felt was a day cut out of my life.  When school started in the fall I could only attend every other day as I took turns with one of my brothers herding and going to school.

	As I look back on those days now, they were not nearly so difficult as I thought.  They were care-free days.  We would wander over the hills and across the fields, making up stories to tell each other in which we were always the hero of these great adventures.  We thought nothing of walking several miles to reach an objective.  I think of the old landmarks where we used to play or explore.  The old Rigby shingle mill with its pine odors of freshly cut shingles, where we used to play hide-and-seek.  The old log school and church house where we attended church, school and played ball, fought snowball battles, played fox and geese and tormented the girls, as well as held our dances and socials.  Here we attended Primary, M.I.A., and religion classes; the Teton Creek where we fished, swam or just sat on the banks and dreamed; the headgate where I was baptized on the 5th of September of 1903 by Bishop Fred W. Morgan.  There was the old cemetery where we would go on Memorial Day and place wild flowers on the graves.  There were the homes of the Morgans, the Carlsons, the Youngs, the Waddells, and the Dalleys where we used to spend our Sunday afternoons.  Most of the old landmarks are gone now, but visions of them are still fresh in my memory.	

	Although we did a lot of walking and didn't mind it so long as there wasn't work waiting for us at the other end of the journey, we did long for a horse to ride, not only to save walking, but for the very joy of horseback-riding.  The only riding horse I could remember belonging to us was old War Field.  He was a fine horse.  When I was about five years old I was riding behind my brother, Frank, bringing the cows home one evening in the late fall.  As we crossed a barbed-wire fence laying on the ground, the horse caught his foot and swung backward.  I slid off behind and War Field sat on my stomach.  By the time Frank got the foot loose I was pretty well ground into the earth.  I had no breath with which to speak, but could hear Frank calling, "Albert, are you dead?"  I wasn't and after a time, when I regained my breath, I told him so.  The horse took cold in his foot before it healed and made him club-footed.  He finally had to be destroyed.

	When I was about nine years old, Father bought a little old bay horse, Scrub.  He wasn't much of a horse, yet he only had two faults:  first, he was really hard to catch, second, he wasn't worth a hoot when we got him caught.

	As we didn't have fenced pastures, the horses, like the milk cows, ran on the open range near the foothills.  I learned the secret of catching old Scrub when no one else could.  I would take a rope and hide it in the bib of my overalls, take a handful of salt or oats and as soon as I was some distance from the house, I would kneel down behind a sage bush and ask the Lord to help me catch the horse.  I never failed to catch him--until the others, noticing I was the only one who could put a rope on him, would prevail on Mother to have me leave my important play, my flocks and my herds and catch the horse for them.  I became rather resentful and if I prayed at all it was rather grudgingly.  Soon I couldn't catch him for myself no matter how hard I prayed.  I wasn't so dumb but what I knew why.

	Old Scrub was with us a long time.  We younger boys learned to ride on him after many a tumble and fall.  We used him to ride to school and to hunt the cows.  He was used at the sheep camp to ride and to pack.  He was slow and lazy.  These faults turned out to be good qualities as on the long rides to and from school we could keep our feet warmer by constantly kicking him in the ribs and our blood in circulation by flailing him with a stick.  It no doubt saved us from many a night of chill-blains and frosted fingers.

	The year I became ten years old was to be long remembered.  My sisters through sheer determination had secured some education for those days.  Mary, being one of the early graduates of Ricks Academy, taught school, did various kinds of work, helped with the financing of a new home.  The old log house was torn down and a new frame house of seven rooms was built in its place.  I rode with the folks to Idaho Falls in a covered wagon, a distance of eighty miles of dust and dirt, to buy new furniture.  What a great day it was.  No more sleeping on the floor or at the foot of the bed, nor be ashamed to have company come to see us.  Bishop Morgan and Walt Eddington were the builders.  We also built a barn for the horses to replace the little old stable that had sheltered them so long--and it wasn't long after this that Father bought a nice two-seated buggy with fringe all around the top.  We now had a way to go to church--when we could catch the horses; also, to drive to the store at Driggs--five miles from home.  Yes, things were looking up for the Hulets.

	About this time Aunt Sarah moved back from Utah with her family, which made the big house a little crowded.  Mother went to Rexburg the first winter after Aunt Sarah's return to keep house for Lenora and Marion, who were attending Ricks Academy.  Leonard and I went with her.  We did not attend school that winter.

	It was while we were at Rexburg that Emma married S. James Callan, of Dayton, Idaho, where she had been teaching school.  In early spring we moved back to our home in Pratt Ward, having had enough of city life, and were really happy to be back to the farm and the animals.

	About 1904, a year or two after Teton Stake was organized, a six-day carnival was held at Driggs to raise money for a new Stake Tabernacle.  It was a great occasion.  There were Indians and stage coaches and brass bands, program, ball games, horse races, clowns and booths where they sold all kinds of confections.  Also, there were a grand Queen and attendants.  We attended several days and each day I had fifteen cents to spend as I chose.  It was a major decision to make whether to buy a glass of lemonade from the bubbly tumbler, a bag of pink popcorn with a paper fan, a dish of ice cream or a few sticks of candy, or maybe hoard a nickel for some rainy day.  Anyway it was an event long to be remembered.

	The ground was broken for a fine stone building for our stake house.  A pile of rocks was hauled, a hole was dug and the money was gone.  The hole still remains after sixty long years as a witness to the good intentions of the stake members and the thrifty ambitions of a few of the builders.

	It was always a delightful privilege to ride to Rexburg or St. Anthony with the folks in the old covered wagon.  It was a long dirty, dusty four day trip, but a change from herding sheep or pigs or weeding in the garden.  When Mother made the trip for supplies as she usually did, she would always take one of us boys along with her.  We would drive to Canyon Creek the first day.  We would usually reach this old campground about sunset.  I well remember as we drove down the dug-way how we could smell the smoke from the campfires, coffee, bacon and horses, long before we reached the bottom of the canyon.  Then sleeping on the hay in the covered wagon as the horses munched their feed over the rear end gate.  Then as the stars began to dim in the early morning, we would dress and climb out of the wagon, water and harness the horses and drive up the steep dug-way of the other side of the canyon.  Sometimes when the road was slick or we had a heavy load, some kind-hearted freighter would hitch his team on lead of ours and help us out of the canyon.  It was usually the same on our return trip.  Canyon Creek was our campground.

	One time when going to Rexburg with Mother, I ran beside the wagon and gathered wool from the barbed wire fence where sheep had crawled under the wire, and secured several pounds for which I was going to receive a young fortune when the wool was sold at fifteen cents a pound.  However I failed to collect on it.  I settled for a quarter. 

	In the fall of 1907 I had the privilege of going to Dayton to visit with Emma and James and baby, Golden.  I went along with Mary who was going to teach at Lincoln, near Weston, the following winter.  She had married Fred A. Coburn in 1906 and he had gone into the mission field.  We rode to St. Anthony with Willard Rigby in a white top buggy.  We made the trip in one day.  From St. Anthony we went by train.

	After arriving in Dayton I was very much at home at Emma's and although I stayed much longer than I had intended, as I had no way back home, I enjoyed my stay very much.  I made a lot of new friends and attended school under my uncle Albert C. Dalley.

	Kate came down in the late fall and we came back to Rexburg together, where Lenora, Marion, Mody and Robby Dalley were attending school, in February.  Although I watched for a chance to go home, they were very scarce.  It was rather crowded for six of us in the one room, and food was getting scarce.  We were obliged to live chiefly on a diet of beans.

	However as I was not attending school since coming to Rexburg, I was offered a job at Flam's store carrying in fire wood for which I received a bag of candy every day, which was a pleasant change from our bean diet.

	It was early March before I was able to secure a ride home.  It was with a Jackson Hole freighter. We thought he was going to drive to Driggs in one day, but the roads were bad, part snow and part mud.  The freighter was using a wagon.  I took with me a loaf of bread and 25 cents with which to buy a can of salmon at the Canyon Creek store.  We only made it to Canyon Creek the first night.  The store was closed and it was a choice between a bed and something to eat the next day for my 25 cents.  I went into the hotel to get warm and the proprietors soon guessed my predicament and insisted on my eating supper at their table and gave me a bed and breakfast, so I still had my loaf of bread and 25 cents when I reached home--thanks to Miss Weekes and her sister.

	After leaving Canyon Creek the roads were really bad so by the time we reached Hayden, about eight miles from Driggs, it was getting late so the freighter decided to stop there for the night.  There wasn't much I could do but take off for Driggs on foot.  Father was feeding sheep a mile west of Driggs, so with the sheep camp as my objective I took to the road.

	It was hard walking and I wasn't used to it.  There was still considerable snow on the road.  I made slow progress besides being "treed" by dogs several times.  It was dark before I reached Driggs.  As I was tired and it was late, I stopped at a house a mile north of town, belonging to my father's cousin, Brother Perry.  They took me in and when I could swallow the lump in my throat and dry my tears, I told them who I was.  No one could have treated me better than they did.  The next morning I could walk on the crusted snow and was soon at Father's camp, a very happy twelve year old boy.  Mother came the next day and took me home to Pratt Ward.

	Among the events of those early years of my life which were looked forward to with great anticipation and which brought a lot of joy and happiness, was Christmas.  Yet I never fully appreciated the love, the sacrifice and, sometimes, the heartaches that accompanied this event until it was too late.  As compared with the Christmas of today, it wasn't very much.  We never had a tree with lights and decorations.  We just hung up our stockings wherever it was convenient.  No matter how hard the times, Santa never entirely forgot us.  It was always a thrill to get up before daylight Christmas morning and bring our stockings to bed where we could feel them over in the dark and try to guess what they contained.  There was always an apple.  We could smell it before we found our stockings.  (Apples don't smell the same nowadays.)  There was usually an orange, some candy, mostly hard tack, mixed with nuts, a pair of nice warm wool mittens that Santa had knitted in the late evenings or early mornings when no one was watching.  Sometimes there were some marbles or a pocket knife and some home-made cookies.  These confections were hoarded and saved for the whole holiday season.  The apple or orange was made to last a week.  Sometimes these gifts were cut down a little because of the financial condition of Santa Claus.  As Mother explained one year, "Santa Claus is real poor this year."  Leonard, with a rather wistful look, brought tears to Mother's eyes when he asked, "Will Santa Claus always be poor?"                                      
	I didn't realize until later years and we had children of our own how it must have hurt when she had saved and skimped and worked, yet was not able to provide the things for Santa she would like to have done.  I think of the hours of hard work at the old hand carpet loom she spent to help supplement the money the eggs and butter failed to provide.

	When the girls began working, teaching school or earning money in various ways, they added to our Christmas gifts.  Yet these we took too much for granted.  My joy was almost full when I received my first story book, "Black Beauty", a gift from Mary.  Being a natural lover of horses I read it until it was almost memorized.  We also received warm caps, stockings and overshoes through their help, so Santa was not always "that poor".

	It was not many years until we two, Leonard and I, as we were almost inseparable in those days, began to taste the joy of giving.  We would save our nickels to buy Mother a Christmas present, usually at the cost of from ten to fifteen cents.             	
	I remember a vinegar pitcher for the table, total cost, fifteen cents; a little white dish, we didn't know its uses, but it came within the range of our finances, ten cents; a couple of little handkerchiefs with frogs around the edge, cost, ten cents.  I didn't see Mother use them much, but saw her look at them many times, and always with tears in her eyes.  After sixty years I have begun to understand.

	I always felt that we earned what education we received.  There were weeks at a time when the roads were so bad or snow so deep and we had no way to get to school except to walk.  Sometimes the snow would be crusted in the morning so we could walk on top of it, but the sun would soften it in the afternoon and leave us to walk pole fences or crawl on hands and knees or follow the ditch banks and ridges where the snow was more shallow.  Later, after we secured some horses and the Waddell family moved near us we were able to keep some sort of road visible enough to follow.  Father made us some skis.  They were good transportation except when the snow was sticky, when they were only a burden.

	School was often closed for a month or two in the wintertime.  Our class would usually make it to decimal fractions, then start over the following year.  However, we did learn to read and write after a fashion.  Many were the long winter evenings we crowded around the dining room table under the brilliant light of a little old kerosene lamp reading "David Copperfield", "The Last of the Mohicans", or the "Little Minister".  We learned to read and appreciate good books.

	When we were twelve or thirteen years of age we were old enough to go into the mountains with the older boys to herd our sheep.  Mody and David would go together, Marion and I and Frank and Leonard.  I didn't enjoy this, but did learn to love the mountains.  At first we herded our sheep with Uncle Rob's and one of his boys would herd with one of us, but as we acquired more sheep we had a band of our own so did our own herding.

	We learned to appreciate nature and found a lot of pleasure in exploring the hills, the caves and the lakes.  I left my initials on a hundred trees which could easily be found today.

	In August 1909, I was taking my turn along with Marion at the sheep camp.  He always carried the Book of Mormon or the Bible with him.  He would read to me by the hour as I lay near him on the ground while the sheep grazed or lay in the shade under the big pines.  My thoughts didn't always stay with what he was reading.  At times they wandered far afield as I dreamed of adventure and of great achievements.

	One day Marion left me with the sheep while he went to the camp a mile or so distant to prepare lunch.  I never was too brave about being alone in those days, so after a couple of hours when he didn't return, I followed him to the camp.  He had killed a grouse and left it in the tent by the cooking equipment, but I could find no trace of him.  I waited for a while then started for home on the horse.  The next day I returned and found him with the sheep.  He said he had gone over the mountain to Uncle Rob's camp, where Milton was herding, for some matches.  I spent the night with him and most of the next day, when after eating some bread and canned salmon, he decided I should go home for some salt for the sheep and a few groceries.  I stayed home overnight, and the next day, with the salt and groceries on the donkey, I mounted old Scrub and started back for the camp.  I had only gone about a mile when I met Milton coming down the canyon.  He said he had been over to our camp and on looking around for Marion, found his clothes by the side of a little lake, the sheep dog lying by them.  Although he rode around the sheep and called he received no answer.

	We returned home as fast as we could and told Father.  He was raking hay.  He unhitched his horses while we went and told Mother, Frank and Mody.  Frank got the horses for him and Father to ride while Mody went to the neighbors to get John Waddell.  Mother wouldn't be left behind.  I asked her to pray.  She said, "It's too late," but she knelt down with Leonard and I in her arms and offered a prayer.  Frank got her a horse and asked me to come with Mother who had to ride more slowly.  We were soon on the way riding as fast as we could ride up the rough trail in Spring Creek Canyon.

	Arriving near the site of the lake, with which I was quite familiar, Frank told me to wait about a quarter of a mile away until they could locate Marion.  Father came down and met us and taking Mother in his arms, for the first time in my life I saw him break down and cry.  Frank said they needed a rope.  I knew where the stake rope had been left so rode off as fast as I could to get it.  They had recovered the body before I returned.  John was an excellent swimmer.  By taking hold of hands the four of them searched the pond.  They were about to give up when John struck him with his foot.  It seems he had either cramped in the cold water or slipped and panicked as he tried to climb the slick bank.  There were marks on his arms to show that the dog had done his best to bring him ashore.  When I found them Marion was fully dressed in shirt and faded blue overalls.  He was laying with his head in Mother's lap while she sobbed and wept over him.

	It was a sad procession that rode back down the canyon.  Father holding Marion on the horse with him; Mody leading the horse while Mother followed behind while I helped Frank gather up the sheep which had become rather scattered.

	This was one of the saddest funerals I ever attended.  The singers, all except one, broke down and wept.  Mother's hands became paralyzed through the shock and grief.  Father sat and rubbed them all through the service.  Emma had been visiting us, but had started home the morning we learned of Marion's drowning.  She returned during the service which seemed to add to the expressions of sorrow.  Mary, and Lenora, who had married George E. Dees in June 1908, were not able to attend the service.  The weather was hot and there was no embalming done in the Valley in those days, so we couldn't wait long to hold the funeral.

	Brother T. R. Wilson was one of the speakers.  He told us that after Mother had lost her first son in such a shocking manner and had had four daughters, she had prayed to the Lord for a son and it had been made known to her that her next child would be a boy.

	Father grieved continually until one night he said Marion came to him in a dream and told him that he was happy and that this was the mission for which he had been preparing.  This seemed to comfort them both.

	That fall Father bought us a new riding horse.  A little stocking-legged buckskin.  Now we could really enjoy riding and could almost enjoy hunting for the cows.  It also gave us an extra horse to ride to school so we only had to ride two on a horse.

	About this time Father began to think of moving to a place where we would have a better opportunity to attend school and where he could raise more hay for his sheep.  He had already bought eighty acres near the swamps from Ray Kimball and which we called "the Kimball eighty".  He began making a deal for the old "Star Commercial" ranch a mile north of Driggs and joining the Kimball eighty, which he finally bought after selling our place in Pratt.  He now had a good-sized farm.  The Star Commercial was the first store in Teton Valley so was an old landmark.

	The fall before we moved, Father decided to sell his lambs to an Eastern Market, Omaha or Chicago.  As the railroad hadn't yet been built we had to drive them to St. Anthony.  David and I drove the lambs on foot while Father followed with the team and wagon.  It took us about five days to make the trip.  We arrived there just in time to load.  Some of the sheep men had already loaded their lambs.  We put on a little extra speed and got them in the corral in time.

	After the lambs were in the cars Father drove to the flour mill and bought a ton of flour for us to take home and gave us sufficient money to buy hay and supplies for our return trip and left us to make our first solo trip to the Basin.

	We camped the first night at Teton.  Not being familiar with the ways of the world, we drove into the middle of town, near the livery barn and camped on the sidewalk.  It didn't meet with the approval of the natives, but they didn't bother us and early the next morning we were on our way home.  We reached Teton River that night where we made camp and arrived home the next day about noon.

	We didn't leave Pratt Ward, or Alta as it was called, until a year from the next February, although we had closed the deal for the place a year before.  In the spring of 1910, I drove to Driggs every morning and began plowing ground in which to raise grain.  I used a hand plow, as I could dodge among the rocks better with it than with a riding plow, which was hard to ride.
They were surveying for the railroad, which was built the following year.  It ran through the land I was plowing and a few hundred yards from the house.

	We each took our turn herding sheep that summer, including Father.  Mody had gone to work for Bill Taylor so we were rather short-handed.  Leonard and I spent some time together at the camp.  One evening Frank went down the canyon to find the horses which had started for home.  I waited until about sundown them went to meet him.  I kept going on and on until I reached the mouth of the canyon.  It was dark by then.  I came to where the trail divided and had to strike matches as I looked for horse tracks.  It looked like fresh tracks going the other trail over the hill.  I turned toward camp and walked or ran as fast as I could.  I had to go through a grove of thick pines where the only way I could find the trail was to cling to the dog's tail.  Suddenly the dog stopped and began to growl as his hair bustled up on his back.  I couldn't see a thing, but I knew something was ahead in the trail.  I couldn't run as I couldn't see the trail, so just froze in my tracks, trusting to the dog and in a silent prayer I offered.  After what seemed a week, but was really less than a minute, Frank's voice called out, "Albert."  I was really happy to answer.  He had found I had gone from camp so thought perhaps I had gone to meet him.  I was glad to get on old Buck and head back to camp.

	We had with us, beside Buck, old Scrub and the donkey and another donkey that followed ours.  It wouldn't lead, but we could pack it and it would follow ours anywhere.  We would put a pack on it and let it follow.  We also found a lone horse in the head of Spring Creek Canyon, which we caught and used as long as we were in the mountains that year.

	There were many wild chickens (Blue Grouse) back in the mountains,  We would begin eating them when they were so small that we could each eat one at a meal.  By the time we left the mountains they were so large that one chicken would do us for two meals.  We never got tired of them.

	This was the year of the Darby fire.  For about two weeks the black smoke billowed up over our range until there were times when we could hardly breathe.  We would sit on the rim of the canyon when the smoke drifted the other way and watch the flames leap from one patch of pines to another.  If the wind was strong the flames would leap more than a quarter of a mile at a time, lighting a new growth of timber.

	During one of those smokey days a sheep got caught in our new pack saddle and ran away with it.  We didn't find it until the next summer when the panniers were all rotted and the leather almost eaten up by porcupines.

	The following winter Frank attended high school at Driggs.  It was the first year for a high school in the Valley.

	In February we moved to Driggs.  The house was a "let-down" to us.  It was old and rundown.  Aunt Sarah and her family had the south side and Mother's family had the north, which had been used for a machine shed.  It wasn't very well finished.  We could sit by the stove and watch the teams go by through the cracks in the walls.  The place was on the main highway through the valley so there was lots of traffic.  The few outbuildings there were poor, but the next summer Father had a granary built, also the south lean of a barn.

	That fall, 1911, the railroad was finished into the valley and there was a big celebration held in Driggs when the first passenger train came in.  It was great to have a train come past our place every day, even though it was a mixed train of freight and passenger cars.

	Mother bought a saddle horse for Frank with some of Marion's insurance money, which he later traded to Father for a little mare he called Fly.  She was an excellent pony.  We traded the buckskin for a little mare so we could raise some colts, but were badly swindled in the trade.  The mare turned out to be an outlaw and we never got much service from her, although she did raise us two colts.

	The buckskin was hard to catch and often stumbled with us.  One day I was bringing a dressed sheep from the camp.  I tied one end of the sack I carried it in to the strings on the back of the saddle and threw the mutton over my lap and let it hang on the other side.  As I galloped down the road the horse stumbled and fell.  I rolled out of the saddle to the ground, but the mutton held my foot.  The horse got to his feet quickly and with me hanging by my foot, Buck started to run and kick, boosting me about three feet from the ground with each kick.  After about a hundred yards of this the mutton bounced so high in the saddle that my foot came loose.  I was happy, but sore.  I couldn't sit in comfort for a week or more.

	We sold the first pony we raised from our new mare to the Dalleys.  He turned out to be a real fast horse, but died in the prime of his life.  Another colt we raised from her I traded to Frank for Fly.  She was a nice animal, but was killed by the train.

	The next winter Leonard, David and I went to school.  David and I took the eighth grade with David E. Smith and H.M. Warner as teachers.  The eighth grade was held in connection with high school.  Leonard was a year behind us.  This was the best school we had ever attended and we made pretty good progress and graduated from the grade school.  School was held in the second story of the old Blodgett and Stone store.

	In Driggs we enjoyed social activities, such as dances, shows, etc. which made life more pleasant.  My particular friend after moving to Driggs was Ashley Wallace.  He and I became very close over the years.

	The following year David and I stayed home and fed sheep while the other boys attended school, but the following year we again attended--the three of us in the first year of high school.  School was held in the second story of the Teton Valley Supply Co. store.  James A. Hughes was principal, James F. Griggs was music teacher, Miss Stevens and Miss La Frenchie were also teachers.  We enjoyed school very much that year.  I held the exalted position of yell master.  The agricultural class, under the direction of Mr. Hughes, went to Pocatello to attend the State Seed Show.  We had a great time; even learned a little.  It was before the days of automobiles and automobile roads, so we went on the train and stayed three days.

	It was the fall of 1913 that Frank was called on a mission to South Africa, which again left us short-handed.  That winter, while attending school. Mr. Hughes talked Milton Dalley and I into buying violins and he gave us a few lessons.  We learned to play several tunes, but decided not to make a career of it.

	While in Pratt Ward I was sustained secretary of the deacon's quorum.  After moving to Driggs I served as secretary to the deacon's quorum there, until I was ordained a teacher.  I was ordained a priest by Bishop William R. Durrant in 1913.  I also served as secretary of the teacher's quorum while a member of that quorum.

	The next year, 1914, Ezra C. Dalby was the principal of our high school.  This year school was held in the Stake House and Stake Office Building.  Mr. Russell, Irving Robertson and Mr. Maughn were other teachers.  Again I held the high position of Yell Master, so was one of the student body officers.  I didn't much enjoy or feel honored by this position.  The high school building was finished for the following school term.

	This year I had my first date with a girl, Callie Barnhart.  I took her home from church one night.  I didn't go very steady nor were we very close.  I walked on one side of the road and she on the other.  There were no sidewalks in this part of town.  Anyway, it was a start.

	The next summer I bought a new buggy and felt like I was on top of the world, until I saw some of the boys driving automobiles.  However, I took several girls for buggy rides and to picture shows and dances.  I had a date with Callie's sister one day, as Callie and I had quarreled.  When I went to get my horses I found they had been stolen.  I hunted most of the afternoon for them.  They were never found.  Of course Irene was sore so that ended that romance.

	We still helped herd the sheep in the mountains and on the spring range west of the river.  Since Frank was on his mission we were rather short-handed.  We had rented more ground so had to hire help at haying time and with the sheep.
	
	The next summer, 1914, one Sunday afternoon as we were spending a little time in town, we saw a big smoke out north of town and someone called, "Fire".  We soon discovered it was our home.  David and I ran all the way out there, but it was all ablaze by the time we arrived.  Very little was saved.  For the next three or four months we lived in the granary, the barn, a couple of camp wagons, and used a big tent for a kitchen.

	Father was at the camp, but came down and made arrangements with a contractor to build two five-room houses.  They were nice, but were not insulated, so weren't as warm as they should have been, but we were very happy with them.  We had them painted a blue-slate.  These were the first painted houses we ever lived in.  They were a big improvement over the old "Star Commercial" building.  Father had to borrow the money with which to build, so couldn't put as much into them as he would have done had he the money on hand.  It was rather a strain on his finances in addition to keeping Frank in the mission field.

	Leonard traded our outlaw mare off to the gypsies, plus a little money for a nice horse he called Mable.  I wanted a good horse and had always wanted Frank's mare Fly, so made a trade with him.  The young mare we raised from the outlaw I traded for "Fly".  She had a real nice colt a year or two old, which Frank kept.  Fly was gentle and reliable, although not as showy as Mable.

	The summer after our home burned down, 1915, while I was riding in the hills one day, I saw a group of people picking huckleberries.  Among them were some of the Wallace family.  I happened to meet a girl in overalls coming down the hill with a bucket in her hand and thinking it was Nell Wallace, I asked, "Is that all the berries you picked?"  She looked up and answered me rather shyly.  I saw it was Vida Hill, whom I knew slightly from her association with the Wallace girls.  I don't know if it was a premonition or what it was, but I had a strange feeling come over me.  I knew she was too young to go with, but she set me to thinking---a lot.

	My education had ended rather abruptly that spring when I came down with the mumps.  I was in bed for about ten days and was so weak I couldn't do any work for three weeks.  I didn't go back to school, so failed to pass my junior year of high school.  

	While in the first and second years of high school I received some recognition for writing themes, which were usually read in class by the teacher.  I was also a member of the school debating club, but we never had a debate.  I was class reporter and did well in vocal expression, which I was able to use to an advantage in later years, when I took parts in plays as I often did.

	I used to spend many Sundays at the Wallace home with Ashley and he was often at our place.  We took trips together, attended shows, dances and celebrations together.  We would often round up a crowd and drive to Pratt Ward to the dances.  One time when the roads were breaking up in the spring we took them in a wagon.  This was a real hilarious time.

	I went with several girls while waiting for Vida to "grow up".  I was surprised one day to find I had waited too long.  Willard Morgan and Ray Little had already taken her out.  I immediately got on the ball and as soon as I could I had a date with her.  I think she was fourteen, but I knew she would get older, so I stayed pretty close to her from then on.  Some of the older people used to sing "Pretty Baby" to me, but I didn't mind, she was all that to me.

	The next summer, Frank returned from his mission.  The first Sunday we had a little celebration.  While he was giving his report in Sacrament Meeting, Leonard, David, and I decided to sample a little wine the girls had brought from Salt Lake City.  After we had each had a glass, it seemed to do something to us. Milton Dalley came to the house and found us rather hilarious.  He told us he had just been sustained as an assistant to the Superintendent of the Pratt Ward Sunday School, so he celebrated too.  My mind is a little hazy on some points.  I do remember Leonard climbing into a tub of water with his clothes on, saying he was going swimming.  David got busy pulling up the vegetables in the garden.  When I tried to stop him he took after me with the buggy whip.  I saw Milton and Leonard, together riding the old rooster.  The rooster, for some strange reason, died soon after.  When David started hitting the wine jug again I had to take it and hide it.  I don't think I ever laughed so much in the same length of time.

	About the time church let out the boys began getting sick.  Milt was in the manger of the barn, Leonard was in the hayloft singing to the top of his voice "... Jonah from the belly of the whale" etc. between vomits.  I covered him with quilts so the folks wouldn't hear him, but couldn't smother his voice, the melody lingered on; they soon found him.

	While Frank preached a sermon on the evils of drink, Kate got some hot coffee.  Leonard wouldn't drink it, because he said he saw Kate put her finger in it to see if it was too hot.  I don't remember where David was, but think he was doubled up in another manger following Milt's example.  I do remember we tried to stay away from him as long as he carried the buggy whip.

	Leonard was supposed to take some supplies to Father at the sheep camp that afternoon and had his horse all saddled ready to go.  As I was the only one able to ride a horse, it fell to my lot to go.  I arrived there sometime after dark.  I saw a large black bear on my way up the mountain.  When Father heard about our Sunday party he said that accounted for the bear.  I still say I saw a bear.

	Well, we had our fling and didn't become alcoholics, and no one was hurt.  We have had many good laughs as we have recounted the experiences of that day.

	Our spring range west of the river had been sold to dry-farmers, so we had to take our sheep out to the desert west of Rexburg and St. Anthony.  Father usually looked after them.  Sometimes Frank, Leonard or Mother would stay with him.  I remained on the farm most of the time.

	1917 was a rather eventful year.  Our country entered the world war.  Mody, David, Frank and I were all registered for the draft.  Mody and David were called up in November of that year.  In 1917 Frank married Ella McEwin.  They lived in a little house just north of our place, which they bought from Ben Jones.  In June 1917 Ashley and I went to Salt Lake City with Kate, Sadie and Clair, Ashley's sister.  It was a great experience for us, going to shows, to cafes, seeing the sights and spending a day at Salt Air.  It was June Conference time, so we even took in a few sessions of conference.	  

	In December I decided to take a little trip to the land of my birth, so with Sadie Hulet, a cousin whom I met in Provo, we took off for Summit, Utah.  We stayed at Aunt Barbara Smith's, Father's cousin. She had a daughter, Luella, about our age.  We had a wonderful time with uncles, aunts, and cousins.  We celebrated Christmas holidays with them.  While there I sent Vida a watch for Christmas.  It came right back with a note saying she couldn't accept so much.  I guess she wasn't old enough yet.  We finally had to say good-bye and leaving Luella in tears, we set sail for Provo.  We took the stage to Cedar City then a touring car (bus) to Lund where we caught a train.  We found a cousin, Hope Hulet, on the train.

     I had to wait for my train in Provo, we so wandered around town.  We went up to the Godard Temple and as we were looking around inside, we heard footsteps coming down the stairs.  We turned and fled down the hill.  A few hundred yards from the building Sadie fell and threw her knee out of place and while I watched for pursuers Sadie worked her knee back into place and we continued our retreat.  I soon took my leave home.

	After our trip to June Conference, I left the group and went up to Morgan, where my father's twin brother lived, and spent a day with the family.  Nephi, a cousin about my own age, showed me around.  After leaving there I spent a day at Logan visiting two of their girls, Hope and Eleanor; had a good time with them, then on to Dayton where I stayed with Emma.  I took the train from Dayton and met Kate, Sadie, Clair and Ashley on their way home.

	Something had happened to Ashley.  He was rather excited all the time and talked continually and would never sit down and relax.  We kept commenting on his behavior.  I only saw him once more after we reached home.  I was out in the field when he passed with someone in a car.  He stood up in the car and waved to me.  That was the last time I saw him alive.  I went out to the sheep camp soon after I returned to help with the shearing and to bring the sheep home to the summer range.  The day we arrived in the valley they took Ashley to Blackfoot to the Mental Hospital.

	It was July before we got the shearing done that year and were ready to start for home.  As we prepared to leave we lost two of our horses, Bob and Bill.  Bob was one of the team used to pull the camp wagon.  Although we rode all the hills and hollows we could find no trace of them, so Father had to hitch his saddle horse to the wagon, while Leonard and I drove the sheep. 	It was hard to hold a band of hungry sheep on the road with grain fields on either side, so we had to travel early and late, while it was cool, and hold them on open ground or a weed field while it was hot.

	One evening as we were driving the sheep around a bend in the road a boy came out of a house and began blowing a horn.  The sheep at once broke into the grain field.  I was working as hard as I could to get them out when two fellows came out on a horse with a gun and demanded I pay the damages.  We got them out and I gave them a note to give to Father, asking him to give them a check for ten dollars.  Father saw the fellow that fall and he said that grain turned out to be the best they had.

	Leonard and I drove the sheep as far as they would go and left them in a grove of pines and went back to find Father.  He was slowly coming up the hill.  The saddle horse, old Buck, had given out, so I put a rope on the end of the tongue of the wagon and gave what help I could with the horn of my saddle.  It was dark and I misjudged the road and led him where the track was washed out and tipped the camp wagon over.  As I ran back to the camp wagon I could hear Father moaning, "Oh Lord, Oh Lord."  I looked in and found the lard, which was melted, spattered all over the camp.  Father's nose was skinned by a stove lid and things were in a mess.  We had to unload everything that was loose and with poles worked the wagon back onto its wheels.  It was daylight by the time we got it straightened up.  Leonard went to see about the sheep while I helped Father get started. 

	When we arrived at the old shearing corrals we found the road fenced off and the owner said we couldn't go through.  It was only a half mile to open range and if we had to go around where he told us to go I don't know where we could have found a place to stop.  When he was out of sight we lifted a wire and drove them through as fast as we could and soon had them out of sight in the trees.  We weren't long reaching the open country and we camped on Milk Creek where we had water and grass, but, best of all, time to eat and sleep.  Another day brought us to the Clawson flat from where I saw them take Ashley to Blackfoot.  Another day and we were in the mountains where we all had rest and shade.

	Sometime that fall, the Dalley boys, Lowell, Claud, and Clement, Bill Knight and I decided to have a chickeree.  The boys were going to high school and lived in two rooms of a house where my sister, Mary, and her family lived.  We couldn't find any suitable chickens, but located a nice flock of turkeys belonging to Vida's father.  Clement and I grabbed the first one we came to, which happened to be the biggest.  We took it to the Dalley apartment, killed and dressed it and put the feathers in a sack, which we hung up in their closet.  The fried turkey didn't work out so well.  It was tough, burned and just no good for human consumption.  We ate what we could and threw the rest away.

	The next morning Vida's father missed the turkey.  He got the town marshal and together they figured it must have been some boys who had taken it.  They went straight to the Dalley apartment and found where it had been killed, so went in and found the sack of feathers.  We soon had the law after us.  We were told that if we would pay four dollars for the turkey they wouldn't prosecute.  I was the only one who had any money, so I paid the four dollars for the turkey and the experience with the understanding that they wouldn't tell that I was in on the deal, which promise the marshal failed to keep.

	Mr. Hill thought that would be the last of me around his place, but I couldn't let a little thing like a misappropriated turkey spoil my hopes for romance, so I bounced right back.  I think he was almost as embarrassed as I was.  I wrote the following poem, which told the story very well:

    "T'was the night before Thanksgiving
	On a silent, stormy night,
	We turkeys all were sleeping,
	Although the moon shone bright,
	When through the solemn silence,
	We heard the back gate creak,
	And 'neath the shadow of the barn
	We saw two figures sneak.
	With bad intent I saw them stoop,
	Then dive just like a hawk,
	But with a jump I reached the coop,
	Close followed by the flock.
	When on the roost and looking back
	We saw an awful sight,
	For brave old Tom stood all alone
	All bristled up to fight.
	Alone he stood so bold and calm
	As silent as a rock.
	Oh, how we loved our brave old Tom,
	The sire of the flock.
	He stood there just a moment,
	And then prepared to spring,
	But alas he was too late.
	They caught him by the wing.
	With hands around his neck and feet,
	They bore him past the door.
	When we'd watched their fast retreat
	We saw old Tom no more.
	Yet, we know the story,
	We heard it from the cop.
	He said he followed up their trail
	By the feathers they had dropped.

	By skillful amputation
	They cut off Tommy's head,
	And carefully placed it in the stove,
	To leave no sign they said.
	With pocket knife and scissors
	They tore off all his hide
	And put it in a gunny sack,
	The meat there, though, they fried.
	
	T'was burned right black in places,
	But gosh, Old Tom was tough.
	You should have seen their faces
	'Til they said they had enough.
	Next morning in a hurry,
	The boys hung up the sack
	And said that they would bury it
	At night when they came back.

	But the Marshal beat them to it.
	He searched from floor to roof,
	And calmly took the gunny sack
	And feathers home as proof.
	The rest would never do to tell,
	But I'm sure there was no clash.
	The boys they got the turkey,
	But Billy got the cash.

	Now folks, here's some fine counsel;
	Some good advice to take.
	So when you steal a turkey
	You'll make no big mistake.
	Never get excited,
	But take it cool and calm.
	Never take the biggest,
	'Cause that's sure to be Old Tom."

	Another experience I must not forget happened the following winter.  The Bevan girls and another girl or two were rooming in the old Barnhart house, midway between Vida's home and the Wallace place.  I wondered if I could disguise myself so that they wouldn't know me if I went there as a peddler.  I put on a real make-up, whiskers and all, and went to their place with a little bag of cosmetics.  I went in and in a disguised voice and broken English, I tried my best to sell, but without any luck.  The girls were suspicious, but not certain.  As I pressed my sale, Nell Wallace slipped out the back door of the house and ran home and told her folks about the old peddler down with the girls.  Her father and Howard came down on the run just as I was going out the gate.  They took hold of me and asked what I was doing there and asked my name.  I told them, in wretched English, that my name was Volinski and I was trying to sell cosmetics.  They wanted to take me to the marshal, Mr. Alland, but I refused to go.  I was in a hurry, so Mr. Wallace told Howard to stay with me while he went.  As soon as he was out of sight I took off with Howard following and begging me to tell him if I was or was not Albert Hulet.  I couldn't see the advantage of an interview with the cop.  I insisted my name was Volinski.  I went straight to the Dalley apartment where I got rid of Howard, took off my disguise and ran around to Mary's place.  I wasn't going to be caught by the Marshal if I could help it.

	Mr. Wallace and the Marshal came up to the barn looking for me as they saw us come in that direction.  While searching the barn they found a butcher knife with blood on it.  Mr. Wallace was then really upset.  He just knew something terrible had happened to Howard.

	It just happened that my brother-in-law had killed a pig that morning and had left the knife sticking in the corner of the barn.  The Marshal found pig hairs on the knife which sort of soothed Mr.  Wallace's feelings.  They went into the house and found Howard.  As they returned home he was grumbling about what he was going to do to me.  I let him cool off for a week or two and they were glad to have me come back to see them.  I had been a good friend of the family for a long time.  However, this ended my career as a salesman.

	The next spring I bought a new Model "T" Ford.  One evening soon after I bought it, Leonard and I took some girls for a ride.  We killed the motor in a mud puddle and after I had climbed out and cranked it, I let Nell Wallace drive it out.  I caught on the running board as they passed.  Nell didn't stop and every time I went to climb in she would turn and look at me and run off the road.  I would grab the wheel and steer it back on the road.  Finally I made one quick jump into the car, but as I did so she ran off the road on a grade, then turned back and tipped the car over.  I was thrown clear, but the others were trapped under the car.  I lifted it enough for them to crawl out.  All together we lifted it onto its wheels.  The top was badly smashed and the windshield was broken, but it would still run so we drove it home.  Perry Sewell fixed the car almost as good as new, but I wasn't there long to enjoy it.  I received my call to the service to be inducted in early August.  I went out to help Father with the sheep for a month as it was shearing time.

	Shortly after the first of July, Leonard brought Tom Cherry and another man to help bring the sheep to the summer range, while he and I came home as I wanted a little vacation before going into the Army.

	While I was with the sheep Leonard traded the Model "T" off for a 1918 Chevrolet, gear shift, self-starter and all.  It rode and drove very nicely for a while, but finally balked every time we got a few miles from home.  We let it set for a year, then sold it for a song and sang it ourselves.

	Meanwhile Vida and I had our differences and she was going with other fellows, while I tried to console myself with Mary Bevan.  But, I thought it over while I was with the sheep and decided something had to be done to get back with Vida before I left for the service or I may lose her altogether.  As soon as I returned from the camp, Leonard, Claud Dalley, the Wallace girls, Mary and Annie Bevan and I took a ride to the Bevan home in Cache.  I wasn't enthused and as soon as I saw Claud holding one of Mary's hands while I was holding the other, I decided this was it.  I sat on my hands so Mary couldn't get hold of them, then when we arrived at her home I told her I wasn't going 50-50 with any boy.  She begged and cried, but to no avail.  Now I was free to go after Vida, which I did without delay.

	In the middle of July we planned a trip to Jackson Hole and Jenny Lake.  It was before cars could be driven over Teton Pass on their own power, so we went horseback--or they did.  I drove the supply wagon or commissary.  I let Vida ride old Fly.  I drove my roan team, Dick and Chief.  There were about thirteen in the party, including Sadie and Sadie Butler, who went along as chaperones.  The first night we camped at Hungry Creek, a few miles beyond the Idaho state line.  The next night we camped about four or five miles from Jenny Lake, where the old Teton National Park headquarters now stands.  The following day we were at the lake.  We spent two and a half very pleasant days there, swimming, canoeing, camping and climbing to the base of the Grand Teton.

	While I was busy driving the commissary some of the boys paid too much attention to Vida and I seemed to be the forgotten man.  In other words, I did the work while they had the fun, so my relationship with her became a little strained for a time--until one evening we walked along the shore of the lake and sat on a large rock at the edge of the water and talked it out.  I decided she was still my girl and kissed her.  This was the second time.  She didn't respond with all her heart, nor did she object very much, anyway it surely made me happy.

	On our way home we camped at Fish Creek the first night.  About dark I found the horses had left camp.  I started after them alone as the other boys were too busy entertaining the girls.  I walked for about a mile and it was pitch dark when I found them.  I had to strike matches to find their tracks.  They were headed for home.  I caught one and removing the hobbles from the others I led and drove them home.  Everyone (almost) was in bed when I returned.  I was plenty sore because I had had no help with the horses nor any supper.  As I was tying up the horses, one of them got in my way.  I said, not very kindly, "Get out of here you son-of-a-(cuss word)."  A white object about the size of a woman jumped up from behind a bush and dodged into a tent.  She seemed to take me at my word.

	While driving up the road to the pass we met a car that had just been pulled over the mountain.  It frightened my horses, which never did like cars.  They twisted around and tipped my buggy over and spilled all our supplies and equipment.  We gathered them out of the dirt and drove to Birchers, on the west side of the pass, for lunch, then on home, which we reached that night.  All had a good time and agreed that the trip would be long remembered.

	Soon after we returned from the Jackson Hole trip, Mother and I drove to Dayton and Preston.  We visited the girls and their families and Mother's brothers, Uncles John and Henry Dalley.  While there, Uncle John gave me a patriarchal blessing.  As Aunty Betsy was with us, Uncle John gave her a blessing also.

	Just before we left for our Jackson Hole trip, a pair of twin girls was born to Frank and Ella.

	On August the 7th, I was inducted into the service, along with eleven other boys from Teton County.  A large crowd gathered at the station to see us off.  While I left with a heavy heart, I felt sure I would return.  Before leaving I put my saddle chaps and my new harness up in the attic of the house, so that I would have them when I came back.

	We were consigned to Camp Fremont, Menlo Park, California.  We joined the troop at Ogden, where there were about a thousand boys ready to leave.  First we went to a barber shop, where a Chinese woman "skinned" me with a hoe she called a razor.  After breakfast we joined the crowd where we sort of took over the town; marching, singing, yelling and stopping all traffic.

	We traveled all night and part of the next day and arrived in Fremont in the late afternoon.  After a long period of inspection we were separated into companies and marched to our quarters.  After a lecture from a big, loud-mouthed Captain, who wanted to impress us with the fact that we were in the Army and were no longer free human beings and must strictly obey all orders, including one not to waste food, we were given our mess gear and sent to the dining tent.  They loaded my plate with sliced cucumbers, which I could never eat.  I tried some, then carefully slid the remainder down a table leg to the dirt floor as far from the place that I was sitting as I could reach.  I was never court-martialed for it.

	As we were under quarantine for the first two weeks we didn't see or do much but march around in a square.  We were given a sloppy pair of coveralls, a pair of shoes a size and a half too large, several pairs of socks, underwear, a tan uniform and a hat.  After two weeks we packed up our gear, blankets and all and were marched down to the main camp where officers of the different companies of the 12th and 62nd Infantry Regiments looked us over like we were a herd of cattle and the favorite officers got first choice, which was usually the larger men.  Delbert Hathaway, John Burnside and I from Teton County, Idaho, were put in Company F of the 62nd Infantry, 8th Army Division and given new quarters; walled tents with board floors.  We had been on dirt floors.  Captain King C. Talls was our commanding officer.  I made some friends with whom I palled as long as I was in the Army.  Among them was Lynn Humes from Albion, Idaho and Oliver Hutchinson of Blackfoot.

	Through correspondence with my cousin, Eleanor Hulet, I learned that her brother, Nephi, had also been assigned to the 62nd Infantry, in Camp Fremont.  We soon found each other and spent many happy hours together.

	One of the experiences I shall never forget was getting our "shots".  We were marched to the infirmary, where we stood in line for hours awaiting our turn at the needle.  Many boys would faint as soon as the needle was pointed at them.  The worst was our second, or typhoid fever shots, when the boys would fall as they stood in ranks until it looked like we had been riddled by machine gun fire.  It was the same while on the drill field, they were continually fainting and falling out.  No one was allowed to touch them.  They laid on the ground in the hot sun until they were able to crawl off on their own power, or until drill was over.  I was fortunate enough to stay on my feet and never lost a day through sickness, nor reported for sick call. 

	From the time we hit camp the officers and "non-coms" tried to put the fear in us, but we finally became immune to it.  I always dreaded "KP" duty and didn't enjoy washing my own clothes, which we did with scrubbing brushes.

	We used to ride to the rifle range on railroad flat cars, a distance of about ten miles.  After practice we were marched back to camp.  I made a good record with my rifle.  It rained most every day for a week.  We had to march through gullies of running water reaching above our knees.  Many couldn't keep up with the column and had to drop out.  Our clothes were all soaking wet.  I tried to keep one change of underwear dry enough to sleep in and put the wet ones on each morning and wore them during the day.  Even our beds got damp and soggy.

	I had the pleasure of going to San Francisco and Oakland along with Nephi and Oliver Hutchinson one weekend.

	Our drilling was hard and we didn't get much time off.  They were preparing us for replacements for overseas.  The last two weeks at Camp Fremont we were under quarantine and were constantly being reviewed and inspected and had to do considerable guard duty to see that no one came to or left camp, nor talked to anyone across the street.  This was hard when the other side of the streets were lined with girls or parents of boys in camp.  We were given real live ammunition with which to enforce the orders.  I didn't have to use it, but threatened to several times.

	One day while drilling, a swarm of bees attacked our platoon.  Private Kemmack bolted from the ranks with a bee and a sergeant after him, while we stood and laughed.  The sergeant called, "Lie down, damn you, lie down."  Kemmack laid down and the bee stung him.  It was some time before the sergeant could calm him down enough to bring him back to ranks.

	We left Camp Fremont in the latter part of October, 1918.  There were about five train loads of us traveling different routes, to Camp Mills, New York.  Fremont was closed up after we left.  We were five or six days on the road.

	At Peru, Indiana, our commanding officer got the bright idea of having us take a bath.  With a towel and clean underwear under our arms we marched all over town, but could find no water to bathe in, so had to come back to the train as dirty as when we left it.  We stopped for a time at Niagara Falls while we were marched over to the river and viewed the Falls from the Canadian side.  We reached Hoboken, New Jersey in the forenoon and stood around waiting for ferries and orders until afternoon, when we finally crossed to Brooklyn and boarded the train for Camp Mills.

	Having had no food all day, we were hungry when we reached Camp Mills that night.  After an hour's wait they brought us a slice of bread and some boiled cabbage.  I ate what I could of what they gave me and found a place to unroll my blankets and went to bed.  I had just fallen asleep when a "non-com" came in calling, "Everybody out and down to the bathhouse and bathe and wash your clothes."  It was really cold.  There was ice on the walls of the bathhouse.  There was no warm water.  We ran through the cold spray a time or two, put on our clean underwear and washed, or rinsed, our soiled clothing in water so cold we could hardly hold our hands in it.  The only difference when we took them back to our tents was, they were wet.  Our Captain thought we would be boarding the ship the next morning and was going to have his company ready.  We were there three weeks later.

	The weather moderated so we had a few pleasant days in Camp Mills.  Much of our time was spent hauling lumber, digging trenches and various other kinds of soldierly labor.  However, we learned how to get lost and only find ourselves at quitting time or at chow call.

	I had two short furloughs to New York City.  I stayed there overnight one time.  I visited a large museum, went to the top of the Woolworth building, walked across Brooklyn Bridge, saw a good show or two and a number of other places of interest while there.  I was two minutes late getting home the last time, so I didn't get to go anymore.

	New barracks were built while we were at Camp Mills and we got to live in them for a week.

	We got ready to board the ship two or three times.  Twice we emptied our straw-bed sacks, sat all day on our pack rolls, only to unroll them and refill our sacks at night.  Finally on November the 11th, the news boys swarmed over our camp calling, "Wa ha's all over, No Mo Wa Ha."  That was it.  We lost all interest in drills and training.  We wanted to go home.  Instead of "Over There", "The Yanks are Coming", we sang "There's a Long, Long Trail A-Winding", or "There are Smiles That Make Us Happy".  But we weren't to go home for a few months.  The day before Thanksgiving we marched to the docks and boarded a troop ship; a converted freighter called "The President Grant" and took to the ocean.  For two days and a night we were beyond the sight of land.  We finally landed at Newport News, Virginia.  I was standing on an upper deck, doing guard duty when we came into port.  I had missed a meal or two, but didn't really get sick.  There was no food.  However, I was happy to get away from the stink and fumes of the lower decks, or from the bunks which were full of sick men.  When at last on the train, I opened the window for fresh air and went to sleep. I awoke when I heard someone call, "Everybody out."  I found I was at Camp Lee, Virginia.  We put on our packs and marched for two or three miles to some barracks at the edge of camp.  Here they served coffee so hot very few could drink it.  We were assigned barracks and as it was about midnight we went to bed.  We had barely fallen asleep when here they came, "You can't stay here.  Everybody out."  They found we had been given the wrong barracks, so had to move again.  Next time we were permitted to sleep until reveille, which was about two hours.

	We were given a Thanksgiving Dinner a few days late, but it was appreciated, as it was a big improvement over the wieners and sauerkraut and liver and onions.  

	Life was a little more liveable at Camp Lee.  There were some good shows to attend when we wished and a Y.M.C.A. where Nephi and I could play checkers for hours at a time.  We also organized a priesthood group where a number of our church members met regularly.  Two days a week we were leased out to contractors to dig trench, pile wood or lumber or some other unpleasant task.  We soon learned our way around, so didn't spent much time on these jobs when there was a good game of checkers awaiting us at the Y.M.C.A.  We had a day off and a big turkey dinner for Christmas, but still it didn't take the place of Christmas at home.   	 

	It was while at Camp Lee that I learned of Mody's death; that he had been killed in France about two months before.  Some of my good buddies also learned of the loss of their friends and loved ones, who had been killed in the war.

	In the latter part of January they gave passes to those who wanted to go to Richmond or Peterberg on furlough.  I didn't have the money or desire to go, for which I was later very thankful.  While they were gone we had the opportunity to write our applications for discharge.  About half of the applications were approved.  We turned in our gear and part of our clothing and took hikes in place of drills until about the sixth of February, when we said farewell to Camp Lee and boarded the train for Fort Logan, Colorado.

	At Fort Logan, I met several of the boys from home; some who had been overseas.  We spent about a week here cleaning barracks, washing cuspidors, hauling coal and doing K.P. until February the 18th, when we were called in, given our discharge, railroad tickets to our hometown and sixty dollars in cash.

	It was a happy day when I at last boarded the train, free from all Army regulations.  I was able to get a pullman at Laramie, Wyoming so had a good night's sleep.  I awoke when we reached Montpelier, Idaho.  At Pocatello I said good-bye to several of my best friends and buddies, whom I have never seen since, but hear of one now and then.  But in this busy world we never take time to look each other up.  Dick Buxton, Ern Tylor, John Burnside and I went on to Driggs.

	There was no one there to meet me when I arrived at the station, but I caught a ride in a sleigh out to the ranch and soon had Mother in my arms.  Mother had been doing most of the barnyard chores, so it was a great relief for her to have me take over.  Soon after I arrived she went out to Roberts to be with Father, where he was feeding the sheep.

	I called up Vida and found she already knew I was home.  Her father had seen me get off the train.  I got my date and as soon as it was late enough I donned my new tailor-made uniform, which I had sent home from New York, and was on my way to the Hill home--and Vida.  She seemed glad to see me, but I wasn't sure until a day or two later when she proved it with a kiss.  Kisses weren't as cheap among the young people then as they are now.

	I went to Roberts and made arrangements to run the farm on shares that summer.  Father couldn't get away to come home because it was lambing time.  It was a dry year--the driest we had ever known in the valley.  The grain didn't even sprout, so I took a job with the sheep, changing with Father and looking after things around the place when at home.  It was a rather lonesome job, herding alone, but I had some good horses; Fly, her colt, Sailor, which I broke that summer and "Squanto" the pack horse.  I enjoyed riding in the mountains.  I also had some good books to read.  Besides I was getting a hundred dollars a month; money with which to buy a diamond for Vida.  We became engaged that summer.

	While herding in the back of Darby Canyon I saw a little band of mountain sheep.  I watched them for several days, until I found a large ram, which I killed.  I had the head mounted and it now hangs in the Scout Room in the Victor Ward Chapel.

	Sometime in August I had a group of visitors at the camp.  Leonard, Claud, Vida, Kate, Sadie, Nell and Nora Wallace, Maud Fairbanks and Mary Bevan.  They spent two days with me.  We had a really enjoyable time, riding and hiking among the hills, and just camping.

	In September, Frank came to camp to help me move the camp and sheep down into Bear Canyon.  The first night in the canyon, the dogs put up such a howl that we knew a bear was visiting us.  We ran out with our guns, but it was so dark we couldn't have seen a bear ten feet away.  He ran away before we could get a shot at him.  That night a sheep died on the bed ground.  The following evening as I went out to turn the sheep back to camp, I saw a bear eating the dead sheep.  It saw me and started off through the timber.  I ran around to try to get in ahead of it so I could get a shot at it.  I only had a "32" caliber pistol with me, as I hadn't expected to encounter a bear so soon.  Before I was aware I almost came face to face with it.  It was a yearling, I judged.  It stopped with its front feet upon a log, facing me, about fifty yards up the hill.  I fired and it fell off the log and came toward me growling and biting at the wound.  I fired two more shots and it stretched out on the ground like it was dead.  I thought I would shoot it once more to be sure it was dead before I approached it.  But this only brought it to life.  It came rolling down, straight toward me.  I had one more shot in my gun and thought I would use it as it attacked me.  I dodged behind a tree and it went on down the hill.  I hurriedly took another shot and missed.  It dropped over a ten foot ledge and into some thick brush and trees.  I looked, but couldn't see it and as it was getting dark, I returned to camp.  The next morning I went out to look for it and ran onto a large, grown bear.  I wasn't so brave.  I backed off a way and shot from behind a tree, but only made him jump.  I followed as he ran up the hill until my gun was empty and decided he would be too much trouble to skin.

	That winter I stayed home and fed the cattle while Father and Mother went to the lower valley with the sheep.  Kate was with me while Mother was away.

	Fred Coburn and Leonard had bought Nahum Curtis' sheep at Victor.  They were busy with them.  Father bought a large band from Garners so Frank had to help also during lambing time and part of the spring.  He and I shipped one band in to lamb at home.  We built lambing sheds there.  Hay was high-priced and very scarce.  We had to ship in a car of alfalfa meal in sacks to feed the sheep at forty dollars a ton.  People would stand and beg for a few hundred pounds to take home.  It was a hard spring and the weather was cold and naturally the lambing was very poor.  

	Father and I bought a new Dodge car which he never learned to drive.  I had to do all the chasing for the whole group, which kept me pretty busy.

	That winter Vida and I had a disagreement and broke our engagement.  I was never more miserable in my life for a couple or three days.  I prayed as I had never prayed before that I could have her for my own.  I finally began looking for an excuse to go back and see her.  I knew there was another boy or two just waiting for a chance to go with her, so I couldn't wait long.  A poor excuse was better than none.  The only one I could think of, which was poor, was to just shut my eyes and call Vida and ask if I could come and get a book I had loaned her.  Of course she said yes, so I went for the book and gave her back the ring, which I just happened to have in my pocket, and forgot all about the book.  I was able now to go on with my work.

	Vida's folks moved to Burley in March.  I went down to see her in May.  She was very much surprised, as she didn't expect me and had a date with another fellow.  When I returned I brought Eleanor and Hope with me as far as Pocatello.  Eleanor had been attending school at Albion and Hope was teaching at Declo.

	I had promised Vida I would see her on the 4th of July, but she had forgotten, and when I came down she had a date with a fellow by the name of Harry Dyer.  I beat her out of the date by taking her for a long ride, which didn't make her too happy.

	After due consideration her Mother consented for her to come home with me for a visit.  So she gave up her job at the cafe and came back to Driggs with me.  She spent about ten days visiting friends and relatives in the valley and at Sugar City.  We took a few rides, on horseback and in a car.

	Her Aunt Bertha Garner was somewhat concerned about her going with a group who were not members of the church, so she got the idea of us getting married right away and accompanied us back to Burley to help put the idea into operation.  It was finally agreed to by all parties, after I had asked her father.  We were married on the 26th of July, 1920, by Bishop Ricks, in Sugar City.  Frank's third child was born that day.  We spent our first week at the sheep camp in the mountains.

	After a couple of weeks or so, Vida went back to Burley while I went back to the camp to help Nephi and Leonard with the sheep, herding and moving camps.  One day Leonard decided to move his sheep down into the North Fork of Darby Canyon.  It was very steep.  I was late getting down and couldn't find the place he had selected for his camp, where he had left his horse and a few things.  I didn't know where he was and as it was almost dark I went back to look for him.  For some time I called, but could get no answer, although I walked almost around the sheep.  Finally I heard a weak answer and found him by a ledge of rock.  He said he had fallen and hurt his back and couldn't walk.  I helped him to where I had left the pack horse and tied the horse nearby.  A little later I tried to find out how Leonard felt, but couldn't get through to him, no matter what I did.  I was worried, but didn't dare leave him there alone while I went for help, so I just knelt and prayed and kept him warm.  Toward morning he became conscious and could talk to me.

	At daylight I was up and cooked a little breakfast; we hadn't eaten anything since noon the day before.  The coffee was terrible, we couldn't drink it.  On investigating we found the sugar was wet and had a bad odor.  We finally discovered that the horse had been standing near the pack most of the night.  The sugar had caught a dampness from the horse.  As we went out with the sheep, Leonard found that his back was not seriously injured and that he could carry on as usual.

	In the latter part of September I brought supplies up to him one evening when he was camped down near the face of the mountain, between Spring Creek and Darby Canyons.  Our camp was some distance from the sheep bed ground.  Leonard usually built a large fire at night to keep coyotes away.  Though I was nervous about fires, we built one this evening.  I looked out in the night and saw the street lights in  Driggs and thought the fire had spread over the top of the mountain.  I called Leonard and he showed me the fire, which had almost burned itself out.  I felt much better.

	Leonard stayed a day or two with me and then went over to see how Nephi was getting along and see what supplies he needed or if he needed his camp moved. The morning he left it started to snow.  It snowed hard all day, and by night I had to wallow through the snow to break trails to get the sheep to camp.  The snow was up to my waist in places.  It snowed all the next day.  I had to tramp trails down to the foothills where the sheep could find feed on the tall brush.  I would drive them back and forth, as Leonard had taken the horses, so I couldn't move my camp.  After a week of this my food was getting low.  I had no overshoes and my feet and legs were soaking wet every day.  I would try to dry my socks before the campfire each night and then repeat it the next day.  My tent was almost mashed to the ground by the heavy snow.  I just had a small hole where the dogs and I could crawl in and out.

	I began to think Leonard had met with some accident as he was to have been back in a day or two.  Finally after a week or more he returned.  It seems Nephi hadn't had as good luck as I.  He lost his horses and while hunting them he lost his sheep.  He had gone down home for help.  He and Leonard went back and gathered up the sheep.  I was very happy to see him and more so when he told me that Vida was home.  He gave me a horse and let me go home for a few days.  It was but a short time until the sheep were brought out of the mountains, the lambs sold and the two herds put together and sent to the fall range.

	Vida and I rented two rooms of our home for a while, then Vida went back to her folks and stayed until spring, when we rented two rooms from F. W. Morgan, until Vida learned we had company in the form of bedbugs.  We soon got out and moved to the ranch.  Vida went back to Twin Falls where her folks were living.

	While in the folks' house, Mother was with Father at Roberts.  Frank was with them during lambing.  His baby died that winter, while Ella and children were at Kimberly.  Kate also went to Roberts to help cook for the lambers.

	Vida and I were sealed in the Logan Temple December 9, 1920.

	I had bought the hay the fall before and gave a check for $8,000, all borrowed money.  We could see the end was coming soon as we received very poor prices for the lambs and couldn't sell the wool, but had to consign it and never realized much from it.  But, the expenses still went on.  When I knew the end was near that August, 1921, I got away and went to Twin Falls and worked on the threshing machines.  I drove one of Vida's father's teams.  We had to have some money as we were looking forward to a baby that fall.  Soon after I left, the Mortgage Company closed in,  took the sheep, camp equipment, nearly all our cattle and twenty-one head of horses, also the car.

	I thought there might be work in the fall hauling beets with my horses Dick and Chief and three others.  I went back to Driggs in the latter part of September for them.  Floyd, Vida's second brother, went with me.  He was thirteen years old and was a lot of company.

	I had a scare the day we arrived in Driggs.  When we walked out to the farm we found a casket sitting on the front porch.  I soon learned that it was Mody's.  His body had been shipped back from France for burial.  I attended the funeral with those of two other boys, Lindsey Murdock and George Smith, both of Victor.  It was a large and impressive service.

	I secured an old wagon and with my five horses, which were in constant danger of being taken by the mortgage company, put in what furniture we had and with very little money we started out for Twin Falls.  We stopped the first night with the Lyman Garners, Vida's aunt and uncle, at Sugar City.  The next morning we traveled a few miles and a wheel broke down.  We took three of the horses back to Garner's and I drove to Roberts and picked up an old wagon the folks had left there.  I traveled all night there and back.  We loaded our furniture and horse feed on it, took the broken wagon back to Garner's and were soon on our way again, having lost a day and a lot of sleep.

	Some of the horses had real tender feet, so I had to put shoes on some while others I took to the blacksmith to be shod.

	We stayed overnight at my sister, Lenora Dees' home in Idaho Falls, secured some more hay and were soon on the road again.  It took us a week to reach Twin Falls.  I was very happy to find Vida all right when we reached there, as we were expecting the baby any time.

	On the evening of the tenth of October Vida took sick.  We took her to a nurse's home across the block.  She was in pain all night and we had to get a second doctor, after having her administered to.  About eight o'clock the next morning the baby came; a nice six and a half pound boy.  Just what we wanted.  I was really happy, but my joy was somewhat dampened by what I had seen Vida go through.  I resolved that there wouldn't be any more.  A resolution that only lasted two and a half years.  Vida recovered rapidly and we soon had her and the baby home.  We named him William Albert and called him Billy.

	I helped haul beets for a while, but it didn't pay much and the job didn't last long.  It was costing a lot for hay, so we took a job hauling hay out of the field, taking hay for pay.

	Around the first of November, I received a letter from home saying a Rural Carrier examination was to be held on the 8th of December, 1921, but applications had to be sent in right away.  They sent me the forms.  I filled them out and sent them in.  As there was no work to be found around Twin Falls, I took my wagon, horses, and part of our furniture and started for Driggs.  I had a load of hay and about a dollar and a half and food enough to reach home with.  I started the day before Thanksgiving.  It was rather cold.  I was afraid I would freeze to death at American Falls.  I would have slept in the feed barn, but I didn't have enough money to have my horses fed, so slept on the open ground on the west side of the river.  I slept with all my clothes on, but had to get up and put on my coat and angora chaps and my saddle on top of the bed to hold the quilts down tight.  I finally got to sleep.

	I got a little hay at Aberdeen, which lasted until I arrived at Lenora's.  I drove from there almost to Canyon Creek.  That night it snowed and two of my horses got away.  I was able to follow their tracks and found they were headed for home.  I picked them up three or four miles farther along the road.  I was surely happy to arrive in our back gate and see Father come to meet me.

	I took the examination and passed and as I was the only veteran who took it, I had first chance at the job.  I didn't hear from the examination until March, so in the meantime I, along with Frank, made a few dollars by hauling coal from the mines west of Driggs.  We made two or three trips a week.  I didn't make much money, but paid for our stove and had a little to use.  Vida and Billy came about the first of the year, 1922, and we stayed with the folks that winter.

 	We got word of the death of Emma's husband, James Callan, so Father and Mother went to Dayton, where Mother stayed for more than a month.

	Vida went back to Twin Falls toward spring.  About that time I received word of my appointment as Rural Carrier of Route #2 from Driggs.  I fell from the loft of the barn and broke my wrist the same day.

	Frank had been carrying the mail as temporary carrier, so he continued to carry it until I was able to handle the job, which was about the 15th of April.  The appointment was for April 1st.  It didn't pay very much for the first three months--about 70 dollars a month.  After July I received $84 a month for three days a week.  It wasn't big wages, but money and jobs were scarce, so I was happy to get this.  With a little for hauling coal, we were able to live.  It was a tri-weekly route.

	When Vida came home we rented a house from Wm. Wilson, called the Robertson house.  We were quite comfortable there.  We lived there about a year.  We bought a few pieces of furniture from Jess Edlefson and a new Singer sewing machine.  I worked some at the ranch and wherever I could make a dollar during my spare time.

	In the spring of 1923, Father, Mother, Frank, and his family moved to Chinook, Montana and we moved to the ranch.  We lived there for several years.  I was able to raise a little hay and had pasture for my horses.  I traded my roan team to Father for some smaller horses to use on the mail route, a milk cow and a davenport.  I soon sold the milk cow, as she was real old.  I traded my best saddle horse, Sailor, to Eph Taylor for a good cow.

	The following spring, on April 2nd, our second boy was born.  We had modified our former resolution.  We were very happy to have him.  We had Sister Hillman and Vida's aunt, Nan Hill, to help the doctor and to take care of Vida and the baby.  Later her mother came to stay with us for a while.  We named the baby Duane Marion.  I blessed him the first Fast Sunday in May.  Father had given Billy his blessing.  We had thought so much of Billy we didn't think we could love another so much, but found we had enough for both.

	As soon as Billy was old enough, he followed me most everywhere I went.  He had to be dressed early in the morning so he could "help" me with the chores.  He was so small he couldn't do much but hold the lantern.  I had to lift him into the hayloft while I fed the horses.  He was a lot of company and I loved to have him with me.  He often went with me around the mail route when it wasn't too cold and when I drove the team or the car in the summer.

	One day after the route had been extended to the coal mine, after we had bought our new Ford Coupe, he went with me to carry the mail.  Billy was about four years old.  We stopped on the bridge over Horseshoe Creek, while we got a drink.  I got in the car first and started the motor.  Billy came along the side and as I opened the door for him I pushed him off the bridge into the stream.  It was swift and was washing him downstream.  I was out of the car and into the water as fast as I could get there.  As I gathered him into my arms he said, as soon as he could get his breath, "Daddy, I didn't get grounded."  I wrapped him in my coat and took him home as fast as I could.  He didn't seem to suffer any ill effects from it.  He always seemed to trust me.  One time when he was riding skis behind the sleigh he fell off and instead of calling to me to stop he just picked up his skis and trotted on down the road.  After about a mile I looked back and saw him coming.  When he caught up to me I asked him why he didn't let me know when he fell.  He said, "Oh, I knew you would wait for me."  I have always tried to be worthy of that confidence.

	The day Duane was born I made the fastest trip I ever made around that mail route with horses.  As soon as I had help for Vida, I saddled my fastest horse and made the 22 miles in scarcely more than two hours.

	When Duane was two years old, he came down with Scarlet Fever.  He was really sick for some time.  We couldn't get much help from the doctor, who said he wasn't serious.  Finally one side of his face became paralyzed.  He couldn't even move an eyelid.  The doctor finally decided he had mastoid trouble and had to be operated on at once.  We administered to him and took him straight to the hospital at Idaho Falls, where they called Dr. Cline.  He said he would do his best, but that he couldn't perform miracles and that his face might never recover from the paralysis.  He operated at once, while Vida and I waited and prayed.  He was in the hospital sixteen days.  A short time after we took him home he could move his eyelid a little, then the corner of his mouth.  Finally his whole face was normal again.  We knew that it was through our faith and the power of the Priesthood that he was made well.

	In the spring  of 1923, I was sustained secretary of the Stake Sunday School, which position I held until a short time before Duane was born.  I didn't like to leave Vida alone so much, especially at night, so resigned from my position.

	While at the ranch we used to have many good times with Milt and Hazel Dalley, Lettie and Douglas Sorenson and Voss and Emma Cordon; playing rook or in other entertainment, as we visited back and forth.

	When Billy was three years old we had our most exciting Christmas.  We had a tree with candles on it.  Mother spent that Christmas with us.  Santa just went all out to make it a big day.  Billy was about the most surprised and happy little boy I had ever seen.  He got a rocking horse, a farm wagon and several other gifts.  It thrilled us to watch him.

	When Billy was small he often had an attack of croup.  He would awaken us about eleven o'clock all choked up and it took all our skill and faith to break it up.

	In the spring of 1927 we bought a little house on the edge of town, where we could have city water and electricity.  We moved there that fall after Billy had started school.  We had no water at the ranch in the winter, except what we hauled.  Father sold the ranch to Brother Nahum Curtis, who already owned most of the old place. 

	The new house was rather crowded so we built a bedroom on the back and made one large room in front.  Vida's brother, Myron, built us a kitchen cabinet.  We also built a back porch for the washing machine and for storage.  We had a few acres of ground which we used for pasture.  I moved a log barn on to the place and built a good fence.

	The second winter, Vida's brothers, Irven and Grant, stayed with us and went to school in Driggs.

	On the 5th of April, 1929, our third son was born.  We named him Sylvester Mark.  Again Sister Hillman was with us.  Florence Cowan helped with the house work.

	I had many and varied experiences carrying mail.  For the first three years I used a team of horses, both summer and winter; a buggy in the summer, a sleigh in the winter and went horseback in the early spring.  It was a leg-weary job for the horses.  I traded around to get some that could stand the road, as well as make good time.

	In 1924 we bought a Ford Coupe, a Model T.  I drove it for two years and traded it in on another one and had a Ruxal gear put in it to give me power to drive through the mud and to climb the hills.  Over the years I traded for and bought several different kinds of cars, including sedans, pickups and jeeps.

	The roads were pretty rough during the winter and spring.  Often in the winter time I would have to walk ahead of the team to find the road for the horses when they were too tired to find it themselves.  Sometimes when the snow was deep and the roads built up high, the horses would flounder and wallow trying to keep on the road.  It took good horses to follow the roads after a blizzard or a big storm.  I have had to leave my sleigh and get someone with fresh horses to go back after it.  During blizzards I have had my sleigh blown over by the wind.  Luckily I was never seriously injured.
		
	One day I was driving a rather wild team and was just leaving town when I met the high school band marching up the street.  The horses became frightened.  I jerked the lines to slow them down and a line broke.  I drove them in a circle, which became smaller and smaller until the sleigh tipped over.  I had a good fire going in the stove and the lid flew off and hit me on the head.  I was able to hold the horses with one line until Harry Scott came and held them by the bits while I got out and fixed the line.

	Two different times I got out to run behind the sleigh to warm my feet and the horses ran off and left me.  One time they were caught by a patron.  He brought them back and helped me gather up the mail.  The other time they went straight to the hitching post by the Post Office and stopped.  One time while I was a mile from the end of my route the king bolt broke and left me sitting in the buggy, while the team went on to town.

	Often in the spring of the year the snow would go off on the first five or six miles of the route, while it would lay deep in the hollows on the rest of it, so as I could neither take a sleigh or buggy or car, I would carry horseback.  One of those times while I was carrying mail via the coal mine, the roads were so bad that the commissary to the mine could hardly get through, but they had to have supplies, or thought so.  As I was about to mount my horse at the post office to begin my route, a clerk from Robertson's store came with a case of eggs and a quarter of beef for me to take to the mine and insisted that I must take it, as "The mail must go through."  Well, I didn't take them.

	One day while I was on horseback, Mr. Piquet brought out four dressed turkeys for me to take to the post office.  After some argument, I took them.  He had a sheet of paper wrapped around them and they were tied with a piece of package twine.  I could have handled them easier if he had left them alive and I had tried to drive them.  The paper slipped off before I had gone fifty yards.  Next came the string.  I tied their feet together, but they scratched and dug me with their claws.  I lost my appetite for turkey for some time.
		
	I carried mail on route two from Driggs for nearly thirteen years when there was a vacancy in the Victor Route, and I was transferred to that office and route.  I carried on the Victor Route for a little more than 27 years, making in all 40 years and three months.  I also had my troubles there.

	One day when a blizzard was bad, Vida went with me.  Some of the roads were blocked, so I decided to backtrack in order to reach the boxes.  I had a mile and a half to backtrack.  I got to the end of the road okay, but only made it halfway back to the main road when we ran into a drift.  I got out to shovel, but the wind blew it in as fast as I could shovel it.  The snow blew into my clothing and I became wet to the skin.  I would have to climb back into the car every few minutes to get warm.  I could see I was losing ground, so I decided to go to a farm house about a quarter of a mile away for help.  Bob Cox lived at this place, so I started out.  As the road sort of circled around in the field and as I didn't go straight to the house, Vida thought I was lost.  She called as loud as she could.  I could hear and see her now and then.  I waved to her and went on.  Bob was sick with a cold, but bundled up and got his team and we went back and hitched onto the car.  He pulled his sleigh to pieces the first try.  Then he took his horses from the sleigh and hitched them directly onto the car.  As we were ready to try again, we saw the snow plow coming after us.  Elmer Stone had seen us go over, but knew we hadn't come back so borrowed the County snowplow and came to find us.  He was a most welcome sight.  We followed him to the main road, then drove on home, where I had a warm bath and put on some dry clothing.  I thought I had done my duty for one day, but as I took the mail back to the post office, the postmaster said they were waiting for me on the west side.  I told him I thought I had put in a day.  He said the plow was over there and would be along any time and that the patrons wanted their mail.  Barbara said she would go with me, so I started out again.  I drove a half mile and was stuck in a drift and had to wait until someone came along and pulled me out.  We didn't go to Cedron that night, nor back to the post office, but went straight home.  The plow didn't get through until about ten o'clock that night.

	I also had my car troubles.  Beside flat tires, burned wires, gas leaks and locked gears, I had other troubles which were rather amusing.  I got stuck in the snow with the car one day and couldn't get it going.  Gordon Jones came along and hitched on to me and tried to give me a pull.  We dug and he pulled for half an hour without moving the car more than a few feet.  He finally gave up and went home.  He had gone but a short distance when I noticed the brake was on.  I took it off and went on my way.

	Another time I had trouble with my old Model A pickup.  I had to clean the distributor once in a while, or file the points.  In doing so. I put a small part in my pocket so as not to lose it or get it dirty.  I put the distributor together, but the car wouldn't start.  I worked it over and tried again, but it refused to go.  Three or four fellows came along and all tried to help me, but we couldn't get it started.  Chet Miller said he was going to town and would tow me in.  He gave me the ride of my life, as I had little or no brake.  We didn't stop for mail boxes or anything, but drove straight to the garage.  He pulled me in and went on his way.  As I looked around for the mechanic I put my hand in my pocket and there felt the part of the distributor.  I hurriedly assembled it again, got in the car and drove out the back door and on home.  I only told my close friends.

	I could write a book of such experiences of "Forty Years on a Mail Route," but have neither the time nor the ambition.

	The last six or eight years were easier.  The roads were kept open more and the winters were less severe.  With the consolidation of schools, the county kept the roads open for the school buses, so I sold my horses and used a car both summer and winter.  When the roads were not open, I didn't go.  It was a little difficult to train the patrons, but they finally became used to it.
	
	There were a few who used to help me when the roads were bad, to whom I will forever feel grateful, such as Dan Gordon, Elmer Stone, Bob Cox and Jim Kunz.
	
	In 1924 I was sustained second counselor to Frank Bauman in the 1st Elders Quorum Presidency.  Also, in the year 1924, my brother Leonard married Gladys Waite.

	In the summer of 1925 I was sustained second assistant to Henry Jensen in the Young Men's M.I.A.  In October of that year I was elected Vice Commander of the M.A. Hulet Post #95 of the American Legion and the following year I was elected Commander.  During those years the Legion was very active.  We held a great many socials, dances and other activities at which we always had a lot of enjoyment.

	In the month of June, 1928, we attended a convention of the American Legion at Ponds Lodge, in Island Park.  We held a big outing in connection with it.  Henry Dworshack, our department commander, was present.  He afterward became United States Senator for two or three terms.  Ralph Packer was elected Commander of the seventh district, while I was elected Vice Commander.

	On October the 27th, 1929, I had the privilege of baptizing our son, Billy.  The following Sunday I confirmed him.  On this same day I was sustained 2nd Counselor to Bishop W. L. Killpack in the Driggs Ward bishopric.  I was ordained a High Priest on November the 9th and set apart as a counselor in the bishopric by Elder Melvin J. Ballard, of the Council of the Twelve.  I had also been sustained a counselor to J. Roy Fairbanks in the Stake Genealogical Committee, which position I continued to hold.

	On October the 26th, 1930, I was sustained as Stake Chairman of the Genealogical Committee, as Brother Fairbanks had moved away.  I chose Ray B. Curtis and Ariel Butler as my counselors.

	The following January I was sustained President of the Teton Stake Mission.  In April Vida and I, along with Ray Curtis, attended general conference in Salt Lake City and learned what we could of our genealogical work.  That summer we held a successful convention and an excursion to the Logan Temple.

	Every spring and fall our stake held a conference in the Jackson Valley.  While riding over Teton Pass with Elmer Rigby, Sadie Low (now Harris) and Janet Killpack, our car turned over and rolled down the side of the mountain.  As we drove around a bend we met a large telephone truck, which was pulling a trailer loaded with telephone poles.  As Elmer turned out on the narrow road he hit a soft shoulder and we rolled over about three or four times.  As the car came to rest by a mound of earth and a stump, I saw a hole where the fabric in the top had been torn off and was out of the car before it had hardly stopped.  Sister Killpack came out right after me, then Sadie.  Elmer's ankle was fastened under the car so with the help of the telephone crew we lifted the car and got his foot loose.  They carried Sister Killpack up the hill in a blanket as she had collapsed and they thought her back was broken.  The rest of us walked up the hill.  They took Sadie and  Sister Killpack over to Jackson to the hospital for examination.  I caught a ride home, while Elmer Rigby went for help to get his car up the hill.  Elmer had a cut ankle.  Neither of the women had any broken bones, but were badly bruised.  I had two ribs broken.  The doctor bandaged me up and I was soon as good as new.

	In the summer of this year we organized a Jr. Genealogical Class, which we often held at our home.  We presented a pageant called "The Ancestors of George Washington."  The members took the parts of the ancestors.  In the fall we took the class on a baptismal excursion to the Logan Temple.  There were about fifty-five juniors and seventeen adults who attended.  For transportation we used eleven cars and a truck.  There were five of our committee and a High Councilman, as well as a few other stake officers present on this excursion.  We were baptized for over 1200 persons.

	The following year we held another excursion.  We had a smaller group this time, but had a very profitable and enjoyable trip.  The next year we planned another, but I failed to reach the temple with my load of boys.  I had a car wreck on the Snake River Bridge at Lorenzo and had to return home and phone the recommends in to the temple president.

	I was released from the Driggs Ward bishopric January 1st, 1934.  The following month, along with Ford Smith, I was called to fill a short mission to the Jackson Hole country.  We spent about two weeks there holding cottage meetings and visiting inactive members.

	These summer days were among the most pleasant and memorable of my life.  We used to go to the nearby woods or shady pastures with a picnic lunch and a little freezer of ice cream and spend many happy hours.  The boys would pick wild flowers for their mother or carve various articles from cottonwood bark.  We all enjoyed each other to the utmost.

	In 1932 we bought a larger house.  It was made of cement blocks and was near the church.  It is now used for the Stake Welfare House.  Here we lived for three years.

	December 5, 1934 was a real red letter day at our house.  A little girl, whom we named Barbara, was born.  Vida was at the Rigby hospital in Rexburg.  She had been staying with her folks at Sugar City while the older boys and Irven and I attempted to keep house at home.

	Vida had started a chicken cooking for our Thanksgiving dinner.  We didn't get around to eating it right away, but kept it on the back of the stove to keep it hot, or cook a little every day so it would be nice and tender.  When we took off the lid it was tender, but smelled so strong we couldn't stay in the house with it.  We had to throw it out and eat something a little less delicate for Thanksgiving dinner.

	Floyd and I drove out when the baby was born.  There was surely some rejoicing in our home when we brought back the glad word.

	On the 5th of January, 1935 I received word from the Post Office Department that I was to be transferred to Victor to serve the Rural Route from that office.  This was about eight miles from Driggs.  The route was shorter, but there was more travel on the roads, which kept them in better condition in the winter time.  On January 27 I went to Victor by train and was sworn in by the Victor Postmaster, Edwin N. Kearsley.

	About that time I was called on another short mission to the Jackson Valley, so I took my annual leave beginning February 1st, and with Brother and Sister William Wilson, went over to the town of Jackson, via the mail sleigh, which used six head of horses to pull it over the Teton Pass.  We labored as before, chiefly with the inactive members.  We found the people very hospitable and I made some very true and lasting friends through these visits.  I returned to Victor February 15th and began carrying mail on the new route on February 16, 1935.  I relieved Voss Cordon who had been a temporary carrier.

	I rented a cabin from Clem Robertson and "batched" it during the week and drove home Saturday evenings to stay with my family over Sunday.

	I used two teams of horses in the winter time, as there were no car roads at that time.  I would drive one team through Chapin and as I drove back through Victor I would change at the old Jones feed barn where I kept my teams and drive the other through south Victor and Cedron.  After a month I drove a car back and forth to Driggs as the main highway was kept open after the middle of March.

	In the last part of March, Mark came down with diphtheria.  We had a doctor who did all he could, but seemed to be fighting a losing battle.  He told us he would have to have some antitoxin and the nearest place to obtain it was Rexburg, fifty miles distant.  Our neighbor, Amacy Clark, took me to Rexburg in the night, over almost impassable roads to get it.  On our trip out we tore a hole in the gas tank and were about two hours getting it fixed.  We secured the antitoxin and arrived home about daylight.  The doctor came at once and gave it to Mark.

	The older boys and I were living in a cabin about a block from our home, as our house was quarantined.  It was Sunday, so I didn't take the mail that day.  Late that evening Vida called me to come to the house.  She said Mark was a lot worse.  The doctor had said he wouldn't live until morning.  She asked me to come in and administer to him.  I went in and found him straining for every breath.  It seemed like each one might be his last.  I administered to him and by the authority of the Priesthood I blessed him that he might have power to throw off the disease and recover from this illness.

	I had to leave him and return to the cabin, as I didn't want to be quarantined in.  Vida, her mother, and baby Barbara were with him.  The next morning I went to the kitchen window, where we had  been holding our conferences, and as I looked in, the first thing I saw was Mark, kneeling on the kitchen floor playing with his toys.  He looked up at me with a big grin.  Oh, what a prayer of gratitude I offered up that day.  

 
	On the 30th of May, that spring, I moved the family to Victor to a little house we rented from Wallace Hays and which we bought and remodeled a couple of years later.  We were soon settled and felt at home in the Victor Ward.  As we were close to the mountains we enjoyed picnics and camping in the canyons and fishing in the streams.

	That fall I was released from the Stake Mission and Stake Genealogical Committee and was chosen to be teacher of the adult class in Mutual.  A little later I was released from this and was appointed Scoutmaster of the Victor Troop Number 82, which position I held for more than twelve years.  I was also sustained coordinator of the Aaronic Priesthood which I worked in with Scouting.

	Boy Scout work was a new experience for me, but as I had a Boy Scout of my own I was soon able to learn many of the fundamentals of Scouting from him and soon had an active troop going.  We planned a good many trips and hikes and the learning of skills, so by the next summer we had every eligible boy in the ward registered in our troop.

	The next spring, Duane also passed his Tenderfoot tests and became a member of the troop.  With the help of Billy and his pal, Lester McBride, we soon had a great deal of activity and interest aroused in Scouting.  After the first year I had 38 boys registered in the troop, so needed some help with the boys.  I secured the assistance of Lynn Kearsley.  We had as many as 28 boys come before Court of Honor at one time.

	Later, as there was considerable difference in the ages of the boys, we divided the troop, making an Explorer troop, with Lynn as Post Adviser, while I took the Scouts.  However, we conducted many of our activities together.  Our first major trip was through Yellowstone National Park, with all but two of the boys participating.  They had a wonderful time and created a lot of interest in the Boy Scout movement.

	The next summer we took a horseback trip to the Upper Palisade Lakes.  We all had an enjoyable time, swimming, fishing, hiking and camping.  We ran out of food the last day, got lost in a snowstorm and came home with our clothing frozen stiff, but we still had fun.  	
	
	On the 26th of December, 1937, the first Scouts of our troop received their Eagle awards.  They were Lester McBride, Billy and Duane, and Donald and Dean Lauritzen.  We had our pictures taken and they were published in the Boys Life magazine.

	Within a year, Duane Johnson and Ray Blanchard received their Eagles and Lynn and I began working hard toward the Eagle rank, which we achieved before the close of the next year.  Lowell Tonks was the next Eagle Scout. 

	We held many Scout activities, such as dances, parties, parents and scout banquets, special demonstrations and skills in scouting, Scout and Beehive Banquets, "Amateur Hours" and quiz-programs.  The whole ward enjoyed many of these programs.  I wrote a play for the Scouts called "The Red Hand," which was enjoyed by a large crowd.

	We took many overnight trips into the mountains and often went to Pincocks Hot Springs to assist the boys with their swimming.  We had one more horseback trip to Palisade Lakes and several trips through Yellowstone Park.  The last one we took along with the Beehive girls.

	In 1939 our schoolhouse burned down and left us with no place to hold our troop meetings.  We secured the help of a few fathers and went to the mountains on Badger Creek and cut house logs for a building of our own.  Lynn and I went up above Badger Creek and stayed overnight and with the help of the Forest Ranger, Mr. Frank Moss, we located the timber and the following morning a number of men from Victor came and helped cut and skid the logs.  Dell McDonald came up with his truck and he and Lynn and I loaded them from the pile.  We had a big load of long logs which tipped the front wheels off the ground.  We had to cut a heavy green log and chain it to the front bumper to hold it down.  Then, when he would drive up a hill, Lynn and I would have to ride the front end to hold it on the ground.

	With donation labor and a little money from members of the ward and some advance rent from the school district, who wished to hold classes in it, we were able to complete the building.  I put many hours work on it myself, but felt it was an urgent need for the boys of the ward.  It was 20 x 32 feet.

	We organized a Scout drum and bugle corps, which created considerable interest among the boys.  They played on several occasions.  One time we made up a clown band of "colored" boys and marched in the Labor Day celebration at Driggs and drew a lot of attention.

	We held a lot of activities in our Scout House, such as Scout meetings and various games, banquets, boxing tournaments, dances and sports.  It was also used to hold Sunday School, M.I.A. classes and to serve hot lunches to the elementary school.

	We began taking trips over the Skyline Trail, around the Teton Peaks, about this time.  The first year, Lynn and I, with our wives, made an exploratory trip.  The following year we took two of the older Scouts with us.  They were Billy and Lowell Tonks.  While in Cascade Canyon, at the foot of the Grand Teton, while we were resting after our noon meal, Lowell Tonks climbed the side of the mountain and started a fire, which delayed us a couple of hours.  We had considerable trouble extinguishing it.  It spread for some distance and filled the canyon with smoke.  We were real late getting to the bottom of Teton Canyon, where Duane, Mark and Jack Heward met us with a car and took most of the group home, while I stayed with Mark and Jack to bring the horses the next morning.  The next year we took a large group of Scouts.  They enjoyed it so much that we made it an annual project for several years.  They preferred it to a Yellowstone Park trip.  We made the trip about eight times.  We also explored the ice cave in Darby Canyon, which we had to repeat two or three times.

	A number of the boys received their Eagle awards, so we organized an Eagle Patrol, which we called "The Pierre's Hole Patrol."  We set up rules and standards to be observed, such as observance of the Word of Wisdom, continued support of the Scouting program, etc.  This continued until the boys began to leave the valley for school, missions and the war, when it died out.

	In the summer of 1935 I was elected Commander of the 7th District of the Idaho Department of the American Legion at a convention held at Driggs.  I had served as Vice Commander the previous year.  We took the visiting Legionnaires on a horseback trip to the Table Rock across the canyon from the Grand Teton Peak.  It was my job to round up the horses and take them up the canyon, which I did with considerable difficulty.  All seemed to enjoy the trip and the banquet which was held in the high school building that evening.

	When Duane was 11 years old his mastoid trouble developed again.  Both ears had been operated on.  This time I took him to the Clinic in Salt Lake City.  Dr. Ridges performed the operation.  He was unable to perform perfect surgery, as it had gone so long.  It had drained for nine years.  However, he helped him a great deal and relieved him from the pain from which he had been suffering.

	Duane had to remain in Salt Lake for about two weeks, and as we had no money I had to go home to carry the mail.  I left him with Aunt Emma Pratt.  I never saw a time when it was harder to part from anyone than from him at this time.  I felt as though I could hardly go through with it.  As I stepped out on the porch to his bed to say good-by, there were tears in his eyes and his little face was so white; his lips trembled, although he tried to be brave.  I felt like the lump in my throat would choke me as I walked down the stairs.  They were real good to him, so he soon overcame the worst of his loneliness.  We were surely happy to have him home with us again.  Only the last year has he been able to get the ear trouble cleared up, after draining for 37 years.  Many times we have exercised our faith and prayers in his behalf.  The Lord has heard and answered these prayers.

	Before leaving Driggs, while still chairman of the Stake Genealogical Committee, I wrote a musical play called, "The Exodus," which we presented to crowded houses in the stake house in Driggs, also in Jackson and Victor where it was well received.  I also wrote several songs which we used in our genealogical meetings and pageants.  I was released from the Stake Genealogical Committee a short time after I was made Scoutmaster.

	In 1937 we bought the Wallace Hays place and moved from the Albert Moulton place into it.  It wasn't much.  There were three small rooms, a real small kitchen and a bath.  We changed it somewhat and put a new floor in it.  Vida's father did most of the work.  Through the years we added to it and remodeled it until we had a pretty nice house by the time we left it.

	In 1939 Bill began attending Ricks College.  It seemed at first that he was going a thousand miles from home.  Although he often came home over the weekend, tears were shed each time he left to go back to school.  He graduated with honors, third highest of his class in 1941.  That fall he attended Brigham Young University at Provo, Utah.  While there he met Betty Danks and in the spring they became engaged.

	The war had broken out and Bill was registered for the draft.  That summer he and Duane began working at the lime rock quarry in Darby Canyon.  They weren't making much money, so when they had a chance to go gathering some sort of medical weed for Arnold Stevens and his partner, they left the rocks and went to Montana.  They were gone about two months and as this was the first time Duane had been away from home very long, we missed him so that we felt we could hardly stand to have them away.  It was surely a happy morning when I looked out the window and saw the two boys asleep on the lawn.  

	On the 11th of September, 1942, Bill and Betty were married in the Logan Temple.  I couldn't go with them because of my work, but Vida was there.  They set up housekeeping in a cabin of the "Log Cabin Tourist Cabins."  Bill got a job on the railroad.  He received his call to report to the Army, so couldn't go back to school.  He was inducted into the Army in October, 1942.  This was one of the saddest days of my life.  How I would gladly have taken his place.  There were a lot of sad days ahead for us the next three years.  Betty left with him and went to her home in North Platte, Nebraska and later to Washington, D.C. to work.

	Bill entered training at Camp Callan, California.  After basic he was sent to Camp Ritchie, Maryland for training in M.I.S. (Military Intelligence Service), a branch of the service in which he later served.  From there he went to France and Germany, where he had some very dangerous and thrilling experiences.  He returned home in November, 1945 and went back to the B.Y.U. to continue his education.

	December the 8th, 1946, a son was born to Bill and Betty, our first grandchild.  They named him Michael William.  The next spring Bill received his Bachelor's degree from the Brigham Young University.  Two years later he received his Master's from the University of Washington and began working for the Idaho Employment Security Agency.  In the last of 1950 Bill was again called into the service and was sent for training to Baltimore, Maryland during the Korean crisis.  His family of Betty, Michael and Barry joined him there.  He was later sent to Fort Douglas, Utah, where a son, Gregory Albert, was born.  He was discharged about the first of July, 1952.  Three girls have been born to them, Tamara Lyn, Judith Renee, and Heather Denise.  (In 1965 Bill and Betty adopted a six-week old baby girl, April Lynn, who was born April 25, 1965 in Salt Lake City, Utah.)  He has moved to Boise, after living in Idaho Falls for a few years.  He is now Bishop of the Boise 16th Ward, West Boise Stake; faithful to his calling and dependable in his work; a proud and happy father.  
	Duane was exempt from military service during the war, because of his ear trouble.  He was married to Joy Blanchard in the Logan Temple, June 16, 1943.  He worked at Hill Field for the first year or two after they were married.  After the war they came back to Victor, where he worked in the drugstore one winter and the following summer he worked for the Forest Service, building trails.

	While in high school, Duane learned to play the drums, as he wished to play in the school band and couldn't play a wind instrument because of his ear trouble.  He did very well with the drums and continued to play with dance orchestras after he was out of school.

	Leaving Victor, Duane and Joy moved to Buhl where he learned the carpenter trade by working with Vida's brother, Myron.  Later they moved to Idaho Falls, where he worked for the Arrington Construction Company.  He had a desire to continue school, so moved to Pocatello, where he attended Idaho State College, and by doing carpenter work on his off days and playing with the dance orchestra at night, and Joy working in a dress shop, he was able to complete a course in Pharmacy and graduate with high honors; the highest of any student since Idaho State College had been made a four-year college.

	After graduation Duane and Joy moved to Pasco, Washington, where he began working for Economy Drug (now Payless Drug).  After a year at Pasco, their first son was born, whom they named Roark Kim.  They later moved to Richland where he worked for the same company.  While at Richland their second son was born.  They named him Brett Lee.  Vida and I drove to Richland to be there when he was blessed, which I had the pleasure and honor of doing.  About a year later they moved back to Pasco, where he continued to work for Payless Drug.  They have bought a nice home there.  A little girl was born to them in Pasco; they named her Mitzi.  She is Duane's pride and joy.

	Today, Duane is manager of a big new Payless Store and has a great responsibility running it.  He is also Adviser to a Priest's quorum and counselor in the Elder's quorum. 

	At the beginning of the second world war, I was given a Commission of 1st Lieutenant in the Home Guard, Victor Platoon, and assisted in drilling men for home guard duty.

	In the spring of 1940, Mother became seriously ill.  The family were all notified and I left Victor on the first bus.  I arrived in Preston in the early morning and walked over to Dayton, where she and Father were living in part of Emma's house.  I found the other members of the family already there.  While I was afraid I wouldn't find Mother alive, I found her much improved, so we had a joyful reunion together.

	She had been very ill and she told me afterward that while at the lowest point in her illness, when the family had almost given her up, she saw three men standing at the foot of her bed in apparent conversation.  One was tall and dark, a large man; the other two were smaller.  Finally they bowed their heads as though in prayer.  She closed her eyes in reverence and to join with them.  When she opened her eyes they were gone.  From that time on she commenced to recover. 

	Just three years later I received a phone call that Mother was very low and a little later, on May 6th, 1943, that she had passed away.  Father had sat by her side, holding her hand, refusing to give her up.  He dozed off for a moment, her hand slipped from his and she passed away.	

	We were all there for the funeral.  A nephew, Abe Dalley, was one of the speakers.  Mark sang "An Old Refrain", accompanied by Barbara.  She was buried in the Dayton Cemetery.  She was in her 88th year.  She had lived a very active life and a life of service.  Her mother passed away while she was a young girl and she had the responsibility of caring for the younger children.

	After marriage to Father, they moved to Snowflake, Arizona.  Mother drove the team and wagon while Father drove the stock.  They traveled over roads that only a skilled driver would venture to drive over.  After almost three years in Snowflake they returned to Summit to make their home.

	Father was called on a mission during the persecutions, where he labored for almost three years.  Meanwhile, Mother had the care of four little girls, one of them born a few months after Father left.  She furnished his main support while caring for her children by teaching school, sewing, or any other kind of work she could find to do.  After Father's return, they continued to live in Summit where four boys were born to them.  He was engaged in stock raising.

	In 1896 they moved to Teton Valley.  Mother was always engaged in some kind of church activity, and continually taught religion in the home.  While she taught a Sunday School class, her main activity was in the Relief Society, where she served as a teacher and secretary of the ward and later of the stake, where she served for many years.  Her mind was exceptionally bright and she could grasp and solve problems which few of us ever understood.

	Mother used to wear a large black cape in the winter time, under which Leonard and I used to cuddle during the long sleigh rides to and from church and other functions.  I have often wished I could have had the shelter of that cape to protect me during the later dangerous years of my life, as it shielded us from the cold and storms during those childhood days.
 
	She was an excellent hand with livestock.  Many trips she made to Rexburg or St. Anthony with a covered wagon, a makeshift harness and barefoot horses, camping by the roadside with only the company of one of us smaller boys.

	When the Stake Relief Society would drive to one of the outlying wards during the winter months, if there was any trouble on the road, the lines were always turned over to Mother to get them out of their difficulty.  She always lived up to her reputation as a driver, although she was the smallest one of the group.

	She worked hard all her life.  When her eggs and butter failed to keep the wolf from the door, she found other ways of earning a few dollars.  She bought an old carpet loom from her sister, Emma Pratt, and would spend her spare moments weaving rag carpets for customers at ten cents a yard, beside making some to sell.  Much of our clothing and some of our food we owed to that old loom and the little arms that ran the shuttle and heatter.  A lot of this we took for granted, but as I look back today and think of the long weary hours she spent over that old loom and of her constant efforts to make life more pleasant and productive for us, her children; as I look back through the misty shadows of the past, my heart is filled with regrets that I didn't try harder to let her know that her efforts were appreciated.  I wish that even today I could tell her that her sacrifice was not in vain.  I know the memory of her dedicated life has helped me to be a better father.

	I was sustained Stake Superintendent of the Y.M.M.I.A. in 1943.  I chose Lester McBride and Verl Bagley as my counselors.  We served for about three years.

	December 8th, 1947, I was chosen and sustained first counselor to Lynn S. Kearsley in the Victor Ward Bishopric.  Lester McBride, one of my first Eagle Scouts and one of my former assistants in the Y.M.M.I.A. of the stake, was second counselor.  We enjoyed working together and felt we had a great challenge to improve conditions in the ward.

		I had been afflicted with gallstone trouble for several years.  In 1949, I had a severe attack and was rushed to the L.D.S. Hospital at Idaho Falls.  Duane took us out in the evening of July 16th.  The doctors planned on operating the next morning, but I came down with Yellow Jaundice, which they had to clear up before they could operate.  About a week later I went into surgery, with Dr. Abbot performing the operation and Dr. Jensen assisting.

	I spent about ten days more in the hospital and was given a temporary release.  I had a tube in my side, which was attached to a gallon jug a good share of the time.  I had to report to the doctor about every two weeks.  There was something stopping the flow of bile through the duct so in the latter part of September I was again admitted to the hospital, where I was given treatments of ether and alcohol injected into the bile duct.  I hope I never have to endure such pain again.  I screamed aloud.  After the second treatment the tube was forced from my side and my clothes were soaked in a few minutes.  The doctor didn't know this and the  nurses didn't tell him, so I was released to go home.  I called Dr. Jensen at Driggs the next morning, and he put me in the hospital there, where I stayed for a week.

	As my side continued to drain, the doctor planned to send me back to the L.D.S. Hospital for further surgery.  I prayed with all my heart that I wouldn't have to go back there.  We had exhausted all our financial resources and borrowed all we could.  The children also helped with what they could.  Mark had to forgo school that year and stayed home with us.  He had also planned on a mission.  He and Duane worked on the new schoolhouse at Victor until Duane had to return to school.  Two days before I was to be sent back to Idaho Falls for surgery,  I saw two Elders out in the hall at the hospital.  I called to them and told them of my trouble and asked them to administer to me, which they gladly did.  Two days later when the doctor came in to examine me before I was to leave, he threw up his hands in surprise and said, "Wonderful.  You are entirely healed."  I knew how it had come about and offered a prayer of gratitude to the Lord.  I was released to go home.  I went to Sadie and her husband, Earl Harris' home and stayed for two days, then went to my own home.

	When our finances gave out, Vida went over to the Teton National Park to cook for the men, so she was away when I arrived home, but it was still good to be there.  I cooked for Mark and Barbara and for Duane until he left for school.  That winter Mark drove the school bus and Vida and her sister, Marge, cooked for the school lunch program.  They used the Scout Building for the kitchen and dining hall.

	The spring of 1950, Mark received his call to serve in the Great Lakes Mission.  Although we were short of funds, with the help of Bill and Betty and by taking on the janitor job at the church house, we were able to keep him in the mission field for two years.  I also took the job of water master, which I held for ten years.

 	Back in 1949 Mark was attending school at Idaho State College at Pocatello.  It was a real hard winter.  For three weeks there was no train and all roads were blocked, so we received no mail, except once when a plane dropped a few sacks.  No one could leave the Valley.  Mark had come home for the semester vacation and couldn't get back to school.  Several times he and Tom Allen left on the bus, which got as far as the rim of the Basin and had to return.  Tom was also a student of Idaho State.  They tried once to ski out, but the weather was too rough.  They had to return.  Finally a plane came and brought some mail.  They took passage on it to Idaho Falls for thirty-five dollars apiece.  That evening after they left, the bus got through and the next morning the highway was opened.

	It was real hard on Mark to be kept from school when he needed to be back, but those were wonderful days for us with both he and Barbara with us.  Most of the evenings were spent with them singing for us.  Days we shall never forget.

	The two years Mark spent in the mission field were usual for us, except that we only had one of our children with us--but Barbara, with all her activities, kept us from getting bored.  She was interested and active in everything:  music, sports, camping, horseback riding, dancing, and various church and school activities.  She never lacked for boyfriends, though not always her own choice.  Her romances were many, as well as her engagements.  However, although we were often anxious and concerned over her and about her affairs, she always lived very close to us and no one could have been more company than she, from the time she was a little tow-headed tot, riding "horsey" on the kitchen floor, to the time she went away to school, leaving us just where we started, with no one to keep us company, to watch over, to worry and care for.

	When I used to go to the canyon to get relief from the dandelions, Barbara would often go with me and even try to cook my meals.  She would put a couple of large potatoes in the Dutch oven and put it on the fire until the potatoes were real warm and serve them to me.  They weren't over-cooked, but they soon disappeared, while I licked my lips with pleasure.  She used to go hunting and fishing with me and was always the very best of company.

	When Barbara was small she often rode around the mail route with me.  One time she was in the back seat of the car.  I happened to think she was extra quiet.  I looked around and found her plastered from eyebrows to chin with Mother's Day.  A half box of chocolates on the floor of the car bore mute evidence to the cause of her silence.  Some good Mother was forced to forego her gift for this one Mother's Day.

	She sometimes got me in a jam by leaving her saddle horse tied to a tree in some remote area of the swamp, or turning over the car to her girl friends while she went to the dance with some favorite boy.  But, we enjoyed it, "hot water", and all.  She was always, from the time she made her first ungraceful entrance into this world to the time she was a grown woman with a family of her own, my own little Peggy.

	Now, Barbara is a mother with three husky children of her own:  Vicki Le Anne, Alan Dean, and Kristen Joseph.  She married Owen Dean Call, November 1, 1956, in the Logan Temple.  Although someone else may blow the whistle or call the steps, she is now and always will be my own little Peg.

	Mark spent two years in the Great Lakes Mission.  While there, Vida and Barbara went with Lorin, Phyllis, Lynn and Ruth Kearsley to Baltimore to take Bill's car back to him, so they called and visited Mark for a short time.  Lorin was going east to get a school bus, so it was a good chance for a ride for them both ways.

	I was asked by the Stake Relief Society to present a "Home Evening" program for leadership in December 1951.  As we only had one of our own children home, we had to borrow JoAnn and Deanna Berger and Jerry Gillett to make up a family.  We had a scripture reading, Vida read a letter from Mark; Jerry, JoAnn, Barbara and I sang  "Silent Night," with Vida accompanying us, and Deanna served refreshments.  I wrote and told a Christmas story, "The Spirit of Christmas."  It was later published in the Improvement Era for 1953.

	Through the years I was called on to do a considerable amount of public speaking in various church activities, Fourth of July celebrations, Legion Meetings, Mother's Day programs, Memorial and Armistice Day programs and more than fifty funerals.  Although I never graduated from high school, I was called on to be the speaker at the County Eighth Grade graduation exercises in 1943.  It was a talent I seem to have lost in my later years.

	Mark returned from his mission in June 1952.  Vida was at Bill's place in Salt Lake City at that time.  Bill was still with the military service.  Barbara and I drove down and met them there.  Mark went on to Provo to attend school, while Vida, Barbara and I came on home in the pick-up.  We brought Michael, Bill's oldest son, with us to stay until Bill was released from the service. 

	Mark attended summer school at the B.Y.U. and continued until he received his Bachelor's degree in August 1954.  He was immediately called into the service, serving most of his time in Germany as an assistant to the Chaplin.  He was discharged in June 1956 and went back to the B.Y.U. to take a refresher course in pre-dentistry.  In the fall he entered Northwestern University, at Chicago, as a dental student.

	While at Northwestern, Mark met and married Patricia Tracy in April 1959.  Their first baby was born February 28, 1960, a girl, whom they named Debra Ann.  They came back home in June, traveling mostly without purse or script.  We met them at midnight in Jackson and brought them home, leaving their car and trailer in Wilson.  We went over the next morning and I pulled the trailer over the hill for them.  They were sealed in the temple at Logan in July 1960.  They stayed with us until the middle of September, when they moved to Alameda, California, where Mark entered the Public Health Service with the Coast Guard.  While in Alameda, their second child was born--a son, whom they named Steven Mark.

	After two years with the Coast Guard, Mark entered private practice in Oakland with Dr. Ashby.  As this partnership didn't work out very well for Mark, he moved his practice to Castro Valley, where he has his own office and practice.  They have a nice home in Castro Valley, where he is building up a good practice and where they are both active in the ward.

	Mark was always busy, as a boy, on some project or another.  He liked horses and was a good hand with them.  He was good company on our camping trips and was a natural leader.  In high school he was active in athletics, making a good record in boxing.  He has a good voice and sings very well and is often called on for vocal numbers.  He received his Eagle award in Scouting.

	When he was about 14 years old, Mark had a severe sore throat.  Vida tried to swab it and started it bleeding.  It bled for a couple of hours before she could get it stopped.  When she finally did succeed in stopping the bleeding, his nose began to bleed.  It bled a stream and we could find nothing that would help it.  We finally decided to administer to him.  Marge's husband, Charles Browning, was there, so he and I administered to Mark.  We hadn't removed our hands from his head when the bleeding stopped.  At first we thought that one of us should watch him during the night, but remembering it was the Lord who had stopped the bleeding, we felt that it wouldn't start again, so we all slept through the night.  He has never had such a severe nosebleed since.  His faith is strong and he has many talents, so his future should be bright.

	In September 1957, we took a trip with Barbara and Dean to Colonia Dublan, Chihuahua, Mexico, the home of Dean's parents.  We had some very interesting and enjoyable experiences, among them a visit to the mountains, where we explored some old ruins of the cave dwellers, of which there were stories of Gadianton Robbers, and Nephites, which were interesting and made one want to know more of the history of the land.  Dean's grandfather told us many stories of the early days of the Mormon Colonies in Mexico, of persecution, and about the time of the Mexican Revolution.  We also saw a Mexican bullfight and visited the Carlsbad Caverns and had a "midnight" picnic at the White Sands proving grounds.  It was a very enjoyable trip.  We were gone about two weeks.

	In February 1950, we received word from Frank that Father was very ill.  He had been living with Frank for several months, after breaking his ankle and spending some time in the hospital.  A little later Frank called and said Father had passed away and that he was bringing his body to Dayton for burial.  The family were all present.  The services were good.  Mark sang and the speakers were from Dayton.  Father was buried in Dayton, beside Mother.  He was almost 93 years old.  He was the last of the boys of his family.  He left two sisters still living, Aunt Melissa and Aunt Luella.

	Father was a good Latter-Day-Saint all his days.  He served for a time as Bishop of the Summit Ward.  He was Superintendent of the Pratt Ward Sunday School for many years.  He also served as First Counselor to Bishop F. W. Morgan for many years.  He filled a mission in England which lasted almost three years.  Although we loved him very much, we were never as close to him as we were to Mother.  He was moody and silent much of the time.  Until his later years, there seemed to be a gulf between us.  He was stern and sometimes gave way to a violent temper, which created a fear of him when we were young, which we didn't fully overcome.

	He missed Mother very much after her death.  He would sit in the bedroom and talk to her by the hour.  He always called her Malley.  You could hear him calling her by name whenever you came near him.  He seemed to feel that she was near.  In his later years he seemed to cling to her as though he was trying to make up for something in their earlier life.  I know they are happy together over there. 

	After the war I wrote a minstrel show which the Scouts and a number of the Scouters presented in Victor, Cedron and Jackson.  We had no building in Victor with a stage since the schoolhouse had burned down, so had to build our stage in the old bank building, which was being used for school.  We played to a capacity crowd in both Victor and Cedron.  Many said it was the funniest show they had ever seen.  With almost a new cast we presented it about eight years later in Victor in the new schoolhouse.  We had a lot of fun and took in considerable money.
		
	In 1947 or '48, we organized a Junior Baseball team, which I managed.  We won most of our games the first year, but when we played for the championship with Cedron Ward the umpire was determined Cedron should win, so gave us a raw deal, which even the Cedron people agreed was not fair, so we didn't get the championship that year.  The umpire was rather ashamed, so has never officiated at a game since.  We took all our games the next year, except one while I was away, and were second from the top the third year.  Most of my ballplayers became above age, so I quit for a year or two, then took on the Peewee's for a year or two, but we didn't win a championship, except won a game by a large margin from the North end of the valley with the help of some of my boys.  Michael was one of the top players in this game.

	While Mark was on his mission, beside the janitor work and water master for the Trail Creek Irrigation Co., I worked each fall at the Midland Elevators warehouse, piling grain.  This was hard work, but I kept it up until about 1960.  It helped us a lot with our expenses each fall.

	In 1959 I was operated on for hernia, which had bothered me for several years.  A year later it recurred and has caused me considerable trouble and discomfort.  

	I have done considerable fishing in the creeks near Victor the last few years and have caught plenty of the brook trout.

	In March 1962, I went to see the doctor about some stomach trouble I was having.  He discovered what he thought might be a large tumor, located over my left kidney.  I was sent to the hospital at Idaho Falls for X-ray.  The x-rays confirmed the doctor's supposition.  The tumor covered my left kidney.  Arrangements were made for surgery at the L.D.S. Hospital in Idaho Falls, with Dr. Steve Hatch doing the operating and Dr. Larsen, of Driggs, assisting.  The tumor was removed, along with the kidney.  The doctor estimated the tumor weighed about five pounds.

	After my recovery I didn't know what might develop, as the tumor was malignant.  I decided to retire from the mail route, which I did July 1st, 1962.  I had carried it for forty years and three months.  It was a little difficult to make the decision as I didn't know what I could turn to to find an interest to keep me busy.  The mail work had been a drudgery at times, but I had had many rich and rewarding experiences on the route and had time for other activities for which I had been rewarded in pleasure and in a spiritual way.

	It was our intention to remain in Victor, where we had spent about 27 years of our lives.  We had remodeled our house several times until we had a nice, attractive, comfortable home.  Our yards were beautiful in the spring and summer time.  I tore down the old barn and built a new one.  I sold our milk cows and planned to pasture a beef in our lot each year for our winter meat.

	During our time in Victor and while I was a member of the Bishopric, from which I was released in January 1962, we had built a real nice ward chapel, costing about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars.  In cash and labor we put in about one thousand dollars toward its completion.  I offered the prayer at the ground-breaking and the opening prayer at the dedication.  President J. Reuben Clark dedicated the building.  We worked hard on the building and we felt the building of such a fine edifice in so small a ward was a real achievement.  We served in it less than three years when we were released.  My experiences in the Victor Ward greatly enriched my life.  I had experiences which greatly increased my testimony.

	One time I was called to assist Bishop Lauritzen to administer to Sister Coyle on the west side of the valley.  She was suffering severe pain.  We could hear her screaming when we reached their front gate.  We hurriedly administered to her.  She said, "Pray for me to go, I can't endure this pain."  I anointed her and Bishop Lauritzen sealed the anointing.  Before we were through she was asleep.  We sat there a while.  She opened her eyes and asked for a drink of water, which they gave her, and she went right back to sleep.  Though we stayed for some time her pain did not occur again.

	I was called, with Bishop Kearsley, to administer to Sister Cherry at the hospital in Driggs.  She was afflicted with a heart condition.  We arrived as the doctor came out of her room.  We asked her condition.  He shook his head and said she had no chance to live.  "You can administer to her if you wish, for the sake of her family, but she has no chance whatsoever to live more than a day or two."  They called us again the next morning.  We went down again.  The doctor was in her room.  When he came out we asked again what her chances were.  He said, "There is a slight improvement, but it can only be temporary.  Her heart is gone.  She can't possibly live."  Again we administered to her and blessed her according to the inspiration we received.  She was home in a week.  She lived about six years and took care of her own home for herself and her husband.  She outlived the doctor by a number of years.  I have witnessed many such healings, but time and space will not permit me to write them.

	After retirement from the mail service we had a little time to visit.  Mark and family came to see us about the first of September.  We had a good visit and started a trip through  Yellowstone Park, but were caught in a snowstorm at West Thumb, so returned by way of Jackson Hole.  Gregory, Bill's third son, was with us.  We returned to California with Mark.  As the motels were all full at the towns along the way we were obliged to sleep in our cars. 

	We drove through Yosemite National Park and saw many of the sights.  It was late at night when we left the park, but we wanted to see the big trees and didn't know when we would have another opportunity, so we drove to them after dark and saw them by the light of our cars and by flashlight.  We drove through one big tree.  After leaving the park we drove with Mark and family to Fresno, where we each went in opposite directions; they to their home in Castro Valley and we to Victorville, to see Barbara and family, where we stayed while Barbara underwent surgery, to care for her children.  We came home after about three weeks by way of Zion's National Park, which we enjoyed.

	We made a trip to Bill's home at Boise and Duane's home at Pasco, which took us about two weeks.  

	We planned to spend Christmas with Mark, Pat and children in Castro Valley, California.  While visiting the temple a short time before we were to leave, President Kilpack asked us to act as officiators in the Idaho Falls temple.  It was an invitation we were happy to accept.  The call had to come from the First Presidency, so we didn't receive it until a month later.

	We went to Mark's for Christmas and stayed until the latter part of January, when we drove down to Victorville and spent a few days with Barbara, Dean and children, before coming home.

	We were set apart as officiators in the temple on February 8th, 1963, where we have served for a year and a half.  It has been a wonderful experience.  I have taken all the male parts but one, and have enjoyed the work immensely.

	We rented a house in Idaho Falls where we lived for about eight months.  We had sold our home in Victor, because it was too far to drive and we couldn't keep it up properly.  We bought a house on J street in Idaho Falls, where we have lived since the middle of December 1963.  As soon as we moved into the new home we decided to go to Mark's for Christmas.  We went by train and stayed until the 6th of January.

	My old hernia had come back to give me a great deal of trouble, so in March 1964 I went to the hospital, where Dr. Asael Tall, of Rigby, operated.  He seems to have done a good job as I have had no trouble since.  Since the operation we have been relieved of one of our assignments at the temple.  We now work only Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

	While I was at home convalescing after the operation, Bishop Hammond came over one evening and spent about an hour visiting with us.  As he prepared to leave, he said, "I guess I may as well tell you what I came for.  How would you folks like to go on a mission?"  It came as a shock to us.  We told him we would go, but it would take a lot of thought and planning.  A day or two later we told him we would leave after the first of October, as we had some things to look after at that time.  Nothing more was said about it for a time.  We went on teaching our Sunday classes until my class was discontinued, when I helped Vida for a time and then attended the Gospel Doctrine class.

	President Kilpack found out about our call and objected rather strongly, but we told him we only tried to do what the Lord wanted us to do and if he wanted us to fill a mission that was where we would go.  We had thought that our call to work in the temple would be our mission, but it seems that the Lord has other work for us to do.

	Beside teaching a Sunday School class, I have served as a home teacher since joining the Idaho Falls 4th Ward.  I was also asked to sing in a male quartet at a funeral here, which was not a regular practice of mine.  We also served as host and hostess at the B.Y.U. Education Week held in June of this year, 1964.

	Bill, Betty and two of their children spent part of Mother's Day with us after coming to do temple work.  Duane, Joy and children paid us a short visit in June.  It was but two or three days, but we made the most of it fishing and visiting, going to church, etc.  Barbara and her children spent a week with us also.  We always enjoy these visits, even though we can't do all the things we would like to.  Our children have always been our life and we will ever be interested and concerned with their welfare.

	Bill and family, except Michael, came for most of a week, to camp in the mountains.  We went up to Moose Creek, where we made our camp and hiked and fished and played "Country Golf" until we were tired out.  While there Alfred Marcum brought us a horse and while Greg and I were on our way to the Moose Meadows, I guess he got his feet in the horse's flanks.  Anyway, without fair warning the horse started bucking.  I told Greg to throw his fishing rod, which he tried to do and the hook caught in the saddle blanket and hung.  I was soon reaching for the grass.  I landed across a pole and broke some ribs and had to wear a band for about three weeks.  Greg got off with a skinned leg.

	We have wanted to visit all of our children before leaving for our mission.  So as soon as our call came, which is to the Southern States with headquarters at Atlanta, Georgia, we made plans to start the visits.  We have just returned from a two weeks' trip to Mark and Barbara's.  We went to Victorville first where we spent about five days and then drove up to Mark's where we spent four days.  Now we plan to drive to Boise next week and from there to Pasco, Washington to see Duane and family.  We expect to be gone about ten days.  Our testimonial is planned for October the 18th.  Lynn Kearsley and Pres. Roy Wood (of the temple Presidency) are to be the speakers.  We want Bill and Barbara to sing if they can be here.

	Our children are all busy and active in the organizations of their wards and are giving their time and talents to promote the work of the Lord wherever they are. 

	Bill is Bishop of the Boise 16th Ward and is also acting Scoutmaster.  The others are all doing what they can to fulfill the callings made of them.  We are proud of our children and their families and our prayers are always for their spiritual as well as their temporal success.

	We have just returned from a hurried and a most pleasant visit to Bill's and Duane's at Boise and Pasco and arrived just in time for our testimonial, which was held October the 18th.

	The 18th will ever be a most memorable day for us.  It was a beautiful autumn day.  Vida's family planned a special gathering and dinner that day.  Bill and family arrived at 9:30 Saturday night.  Michael and Tamara came with us earlier in the day.  Michael drove all the way from Boise.  Bernice came early Sunday afternoon and brought Charles and Marge with her.  Roy and Kenneth and their families came about the same time.  Duane came in on the bus, just before they arrived, which surprised us very much, as we knew his time was limited and it was a long trip to make.

	Barbara called and told us she would be unable to come, but would be thinking of us all the time.  We knew she would and also knew that she would be with us if at all possible.

	From Bernice we learned that Mark had flown in a couple of days before and had gone hunting with Irven and Lee.  This was also a great surprise and gave us a thrill.  Wilma and Lee came later in the afternoon.  We had phone calls all day from people who were unable to come to the testimonial.  Frank came to the house, then Sadie, Earl, Lettie, Douglas, Lillian and her daughter Sherrill came to stay a while.  The house was so full and there was so much confusion that it was impossible to visit, yet we enjoyed seeing them all.

	We had a real large crowd at the service.  There were people from Victor, Driggs, and many friends from around this area and about twenty temple officiators, which tended to gladden our hearts.  The expressions of love and friendship almost overwhelmed us.

	We arranged our own program and the Bishopric had some extra nice copies prepared.  Our first song was "The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning," by the congregation.  The opening prayer was by Irven Hill.  The sacrament song was by the congregation, "I Know That My Redeemer Lives."  Pres. Lynn Kearsley, my associate of so many years, spoke.  Bill sang "I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked," after which Pres. Roy Wood spoke to us.  Sister Susana Leavitt sang "My Faith in Thee".  Vida and I each made a few remarks, followed by Bishop Jay B. Hammond.  Frank offered the benediction after the congregation sang "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go." 

	There was a large crowd and many said it was the best meeting of its kind they had ever attended.  Our hearts were full and the love and friendship shown us by those who attended was something we had never experienced.

	We sat up until after midnight when we and Mark took Duane to catch the bus for Pasco.  Bill and family planned to leave about four so went to bed a little earlier.  He had to be back to work the next morning and the children had to go to school, so they were up early and we didn't get much sleep.  But it was a wonderful occasion and we will think of it often during the two years ahead.

	We have to attend a couple of parties and a dinner before we go.  Tonight we go to Victor where our club of other years has planned a party for us.  Tomorrow night our little Sunday night fireside group have something planned for us.  The next night we are invited to Bishop Hammond's for dinner.  Our time is well taken until we leave, which we plan to do next Friday afternoon.  Mark will fly back to Castro Valley tomorrow.  Then we will feel like it is all over but the mission.

	This brings us up to date, this 19th day of October, 1964.  If we can manage it we may have considerable to add when we return.  
     

         PART TWO OF THE STORY OF ALBERT F. HULET



	After a lapse of more than four years I find myself still alive and enjoying life, so will try to call to mind a few of the highlights of the past few years.  Many things that were important at the time have grown dim with the years so this may not be as detailed as the earlier part of my story.  However life is still interesting and still has many opportunities in store for us after we are past the allotted age of three score and ten. 

	Memories of the past seem to crowd our thoughts as the end draws nearer and we dream of the happy days we have experienced in the past.  Even the trials and hardships add interest to our reminiscences of earlier years.

	After my hernia operation the latter part of March 1964, while convalescing at home, Bishop Hammond came over one evening and sat and visited for some time.  When he was ready to leave he said, "Well I guess I may as well tell you what I came for.  How would you folks like to go on a mission?"  There is no denying this was a great shock to us as a mission was the farthest thing from our minds at this time.  We discussed it for a few moments and told him we would go but would have to think it over for a few days before we could tell him how or when.  After a day or two of consideration we told him we would go but would rather wait until fall when we received a payment on our home in Victor so that we could put our financial affairs in order.  It was decided to wait a few months before sending our names in to the Missionary Committee.

	We went back to the temple, where we worked through the summer months.  Our names were sent in for the mission call sometime in August.

	Early in June we were saddened by the death of our close friend Lester McBride, who had been suffering for some time from cancer.  I was asked to speak at his funeral.

	Mark and family came for a short visit about the first of September.  While they were here we received our call to the Southern States Mission.  We were to report to the mission home October 26, 1964.

	We continued our visit with Mark and family, fishing and attending the melodrama in Victor, where Pat threw a fit because Vida held Mark's hand during part of the show.

	We continued making preparations for our trip to the mission field.  As we wanted to visit our children before we left, we accompanied Mark and family part way home, leaving them at Stockton.  We continued on to Barbara's and visited there, then we drove to Mark's where we visited Mark and family.  Our visit there suffered sort of a blight when Pat ordered us out of the house and we were told not to come back, which left us with a rather sick feeling as we left Mark under these conditions.  We left early the next morning.

	Later we drove to Boise, stopping overnight with my sister Kate, living in Murtaugh.  We spent two or three days with Billy and family, then drove to Pasco, Washington, where we visited Duane, Joy and family, returning home a few days before our testimonial.

	We also drove to Riverton, Wyoming and visited Milt and Hazel Dalley, where we were always cordially received and we enjoyed ourselves.

	We decided to rent our home to help out with the expense of our mission.  At first we expected to rent it furnished, but just before leaving we were advised that the supervisor of the building of the 18th and 19th Ward's chapel would rent the house but wanted it unfurnished.  So we hurriedly made arrangements to store most of the furniture in Irven's basement.  We left the piano, the freezer, and the washer and dryer in the house.  Irven hauled nearly all of the furniture down to his place in his van.

	Our testimonial was held on the 18th of October.  Brothers Roy Wood and Lynn Kearsley were the speakers.  Bill sang, "I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked."  Sister Leavitt sang, "My Faith in Thee."  Two congregational hymns were, "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go," and "God Be With You Till We Meet Again."  Irven offered the opening prayer, Frank gave the benediction.

	All of our children were there but Barbara.  Mark flew up, Duane came the last minute and surprised us.  Bill and his family were there.  There was a good attendance.  Quite a number came from Driggs and Victor, plus Frank, Lenora, Sadie and Earl and Lillian and Sherrill.  We received more than three hundred dollars in contributions to help us on our way.

	We left here Friday the 23rd and drove to Irven's and stayed overnight, then on to Ogden, stopping at Emma's and Leonard's on our way. 

	We stayed overnight with Marge and Charles in Ogden and spent Sunday with them, then Monday we drove to Salt Lake to the mission home, where we were checked in and given a room.  We put the car with its load in the Temple Square garage.

	We attended classes three times a day and ate our meals at the Hotel Utah.  We were kept real busy most of the time.

	Wednesday afternoon we had our pictures taken and were given a little time to shop for clothing and books and were set apart for our missions by Elder Sonne.  We continued our classes the rest of the week.  Saturday afternoon we went through the temple twice.  Sunday morning we held a meeting and I helped administer to the Sacrament.  We heard several testimonies.

	Sunday afternoon we were free to eat dinner and visit with friends and relations.  Marge, Irven and Bernice came.  We were thrilled beyond words to express, to see them.  It seemed we had been gone for months.  They stayed for the testimony meeting in the assembly hall that night where we each expressed in three or four words our faith, and gave our names and stake, and mission to which we were called.  We drove back to Marge's and spent the night.

	About eight o'clock Monday morning, the 2nd of November, we turned our backs on everything we had called home, and our face toward a new country, new experiences, and a somewhat new life.  We drove to Rawlings, Wyoming that day, where we stopped and rested and stayed overnight, leaving early the next morning.

	Since we had been invited to stop overnight at the Leon Danks home, we drove to North Platte, arriving after dark.  We were well received by the Danks'.  We had a good night's rest and were on our way early the next morning, hoping to be well into the state of Iowa by evening.  After taking a detour we somewhat lost our way and evening found us near Des Moines, a hundred miles out of our way from the place we had intended to stop.  It was a gloomy evening with a drizzly rain falling.  Vida felt that we were lost and a long way from home, so gave way to a few tears.  We found a motel and a cafe' nearby and were soon settled for the night.  Vida felt better and looked forward to getting back on our road again.

	Thursday about ten o'clock we crossed the Mississippi River at Fort Madison, and from there we went to Nauvoo.  We drove around Nauvoo for some time but couldn't find an L.D.S. guide so we went with a Reorganized Church missionary through the Joseph Smith home, to the Prophet's grave and to the Mansion house.  After lunch we drove on to Carthage, where we spent some time taking pictures and listened to the lecture by a Sister, the wife of the custodian.  We drove on to Beardstown that night, which is several miles from Carthage.  Friday we were out early and on the road.  We had intended to see the Lincoln Monument in Springfield, but it was so foggy we could see but a few rods in front of us so we stayed with the road and drove southeast to the city of Cairo, where we crossed the Ohio River.  The fog lifted, so our drive was more pleasant after about ten a.m.

	We spent the afternoon driving through a corner of Kentucky and eastward through Tennessee.  We thought we might make it to Chattanooga, the old Southern States Mission headquarters, but the road was long and the days were short, so we stopped for the night at the town of Floyd, as I remember, about 260 miles from our intended destination. 

	Each night our prayers were full of thanks to our Heavenly Father for his guidance and protection through the past day.  In the mornings our petitions were for continued direction through the day, that we might travel safely and have no serious delay.

	We found a road on the map bypassing Chattanooga, which we took and which turned out to be little more than a trail.  We climbed hills and forded streams until at last we found a paved road which led to the main highway to Atlanta.  We followed this all day, with hardly time out to eat.  We found the countryside very interesting and could have spent more time if we had not planned to reach the mission home and report that night.

	Toward evening a light rain began to fall.  As we drove into Atlanta we were confronted by a maze of streets and cloverleaves. Having only an address, and not even sure of our directions or what part of the city the mission was in, we took the first street to the left.  We followed this for what seemed several miles through a colored section until we finally came to a service station with a white attendant.  We stopped and asked the direction to the street, East Lake Road.  He told us to turn left and follow the railroad track and it would take us to it.  We followed the track for about two miles and came to the street and another service station with a white attendant.  We asked him where to find our address.  He directed us to the left about two or three blocks to the mission home.  We were soon there and were given the president's room as he was away for the night.  We were tired but not too tired to get down on our knees and thank our Eternal Father for bringing us safely through this strange and complex traffic route to our destination.  To us it was nothing short of a miracle that we could reach the place by about the most direct route possible.

	That night about ten o'clock I was called to the phone.  The mission president, President Hunsaker, was calling.  He gave us our instructions, which were to go to Greenwood, South Carolina, get ourselves an apartment and work with the inactive members.  Also, since the Abbeville branch had been closed the members there had their feelings hurt and were refusing to support the Greenwood branch, and he wished us to help them to overcome this prejudice and make peace between the members.  I told him, "With the help of the Lord, we will do it."

	We were given the address of the branch president, O'Dell Stone.  We reached Greenwood about 2:00 p.m. but found the house vacant where the president had lived, so we got ourselves a motel room and found Stone's name in the phone book and called him.  He said he would come and take us to Sacrament Meeting that evening, which he did.  We found the Stones very likeable people.  They were in their thirties and had four children ranging from four to eight years of age.  

	There were two Elders called to work in this area.  They were living in part of the building used for church meetings.  There were sixteen at meeting that evening, including us four missionaries.  We could see there was room for a lot of work to be done.  They had no organist and not many to sing.  Vida was asked to play for them, which was our first step of progress.

	After the meeting President Stone and family showed us the town, which didn't take long, as it only has about 20,000 people.  We were tired and glad to get to sit but anxious to find an apartment and get settled so we could start to work.

	The next morning we got a newspaper and looked for apartments for rent.  We called two or three but could only get an answer from one a couple of Greenwood blocks from the church.  It was $20 a week plus utilities.  It was a two-room apartment, upstairs, with a community bath down the hall.  The rooms were large and bare, with a bed built like an inverted barrel.  Fifteen noisy dogs howled under the window all night.  We stayed just one week and found a downstairs garage apartment with three small rooms, for 50 dollars a month plus utilities.  We got along here very well until the first big rain, which backed up around the building and as the garage floor was flat on the ground, we were almost flooded out.  When I opened the door a gush of water came in that flooded every room.  We gathered all we could and put it up on the bed and table.  It was dark outside but I succeeded getting some of it drained away and went for the landlord.  Between us we got the drain open and Vida swept the water out of the house.  We kept the drains open after that.

	We began visiting the members, four or five homes a day. On Sundays and Tuesday evenings we would drive thirteen or fourteen miles to bring members to church.  The attendance began to increase until we had around thirty-five average on Sundays.  The Sacrament Meetings changed to directly after Sunday School.  This helped the Sacrament Meeting attendance.

	We soon found we had a steady job of running a taxi for the members: on Sundays, Monday evenings for Relief Society meetings, and Wednesday for Primary, as well as Tuesday for M.I.A.  It seemed we were constantly on the road.  Some of the brethren would bring their wives to Relief Society and go home, leaving us to bring their wives home after meeting was out, and were very good-natured about it.

	We soon began to make friends with the members, which friendships grew closer as time went on.  The Stones, the Pattersons, the Martin Smiths, and the Carnells were especially close to us.

	We found a number who had been inactive so long they had no interest in the church whatsoever.  A few asked to have their names removed from the church records.  One thing that caused us concern and some trouble was the number of young people who had been baptized without conversion.  There were about fifty of these in and around Greenwood.  Those who would have become active were not permitted to do so by their parents.  Many were not given one discussion nor had ever attended church.  Some were baptized on a dare or bribed by a hamburger or a bottle of pop.

	We spent our first Thanksgiving away from home with the Stones, along with the Elders.  We had a good dinner and while the ladies visited, the Elders, President Stone and I practiced singing.

	Christmas was a rather gloomy time.  We were homesick.  We received some nice gifts--but we felt the great distance between.  A card from Pat didn't help us any, as she spewed out her venom upon us simply because we were Mark's parents. 

	The Elders had Christmas dinner with us.  Elder Neil was even more homesick than we so they spent considerable time with us.  Elder Brinkerhoff's time was nearly up so he was over his homesickness and was happy in the thought that his work was almost completed.

	After Christmas time a rift began to show up in the branch presidency.  Bro. Patterson, who was first counselor, felt he was being ignored by the president.  He tried to resign but the president wouldn't accept his resignation.  The rift grew until there were real feelings between them.  I took it up with the mission president at district conference at North.  He asked the district presidency to come down and straighten it out.  The weather was bad so only the 2nd counselor came.  He held two meetings with the priesthood.  I was not at the first but I heard it ended in a row.  After that meeting we held another.  The charges and counter charges were flung freely at one another.  It seemed all of them wanted to get into the act until I was disgusted and moved we adjourn.  It was immediately seconded, and Pres. Hawkins had the meeting dismissed by one of the Elders.  The mission president heard of this and sent President Brown, District President, to Greenwood.  I was not at the meeting as I was in bed with the flu.  The meeting was no better than before.  They all walked out on President Brown.

	Two weeks later, President Hunsaker and his counselor, Brother Peterson, came and held meetings with each of the members of the branch presidency.  I was finally called in and after some deliberation they asked me to take the position of first counselor to Pres. Stone, releasing Bro. Patterson.  Martin Smith was second counselor.  I was to be the buffer and help to stabilize the group.  I took it on condition that we reorganize the auxiliaries of the whole branch, which they thought was a good idea as feelings had been created among the members until there was no harmony in the different organizations.

	Vida was given the Primary, and, as Sister Carnell was leaving, Sister Patterson was made President of the Relief Society.  Bro. Yingling was made Sunday School President, Sister Yingling the Young Women's M.I.A. President, and Brother Patterson the Young Men's President.
	
	The organizations prospered until in May when Sister Stone called me one night and asked if her husband was at our place and if he had spent some time there lately.  I reported that he was not there nor had been there for some time.  She asked to see me the following night at M.I.A.  Instead of going to class we sat on the porch and talked.  She told me that O'Dell had been telling her that he had been to my place or at the church working on records several times a week but she had learned that this was not so.  She had found lipstick on his shirt and blond hair on his comb.  I tried to find a simple excuse for all this.  She finally found an address in his wallet.  She gave this to me over the phone.  She asked us to follow him or watch this address.  Since he gave us the slip I asked the Elders to help me.  We followed him to this address and found his car there one night.  We brought her over to see it but we didn't bother him.  She wanted to take the car and children and go home to West Virginia as soon as she could get her driver's license.

	District Conference was coming up soon.  Sister Stone asked if she could go with us to conference as she wanted to talk to President Evanson, who was now Mission President.  We took her with us to conference and she and I had a talk with the President.  He said he would come over in a few days to take care of what had to be done.

	That night after arriving home the Stones got in an argument and Sister Stone told him all she knew about his affair.  He cried and begged her forgiveness and promised it would never happen again, which she doubted, as she had had the same trouble a few years before in West Virginia.

	About a week later President Evanson called to tell me he would be up at a certain time.  I took him to the mill where Pres. Stone was working, where he received a full confession.  As there seemed to be no adultery involved, he decided to take no action against him other than releasing him from his position as president of the branch.  He asked me to take his place.  He told me to choose some counselors and he would have Brother Miner, who acted as assistant at times, come over and reorganize the branch.  I chose Martin Smith as my first counselor and Marion S. Patterson as my second counselor.  We later made Brother Stone Sunday School Superintendent.

	We were given some names by the mission president of members who were lost as far as the mission was concerned.  They had moved and left no address and had not contacted the church in any new area.  We had a number of these names to look for.  One was a John H. Von Holland.  We found him, much to his joy, and he became active and was soon ordained an Elder.  He had held no priesthood previously.  He was 80 years old.  We found a Lovena Turner, who was teaching in a Baptist Sunday School.  She too rejoiced in being found and again being affiliated with the church.  We also found the home of another, Edna Wood.  While visiting her we learned her mother, who was past 80, did not belong, so I started to teach her.  We found her a ready and willing pupil.  She seemed to grasp the teachings with no trouble as her daughter had belonged for some time and the Elders had been in her home many times.  She was soon ready for baptism.  The zone leader came and interviewed her so on the 15th of May she was baptized by Elder Jensen.  I confirmed her. 
 	
	Soon after we came to Greenwood we were given the names of two women who were interested in the church:  Mrs. Jessie Agnew and Mrs. Taylor.  We gave them the first discussion.  They wanted more.  But Mrs. Taylor's friends got hold of her and she soon dropped out.  We continued to visit Mrs. Agnew.  Sometimes we taught the gospel, other times we just visited.  We made a good friend of her.  The following year, in July, she asked for baptism.  We were ready to go when her husband blew up and caused a fuss so we postponed it.  Two weeks later, after he had had time to cool off, I asked him if he objected to her being baptized.  He said, "Not at all."  It was perfectly all right with him if that was what she wanted.  I invited him to go with us to Geoffrey where we were going to baptize her.  We all fasted that day and drove to Gafney together.  Elder Shepherd baptized her in July 1966.  I confirmed her a member of the church.  The Elders baptized several but only a few remained active.

	In March we had what was a new experience for most of the brethren.  An elderly sister, Sister Carroll, passed away in Abbeville so we had the responsibility of holding the funeral service.  None of the other brethren had ever attended more than one or two funerals, let alone take part in one, so it was left to me to take charge and conduct it .  Our music was a problem.  Our chorister was in Washington with a group of students.  The two Elders could sing but couldn't read music or sing different parts.  Pres. Stone and I started it.  We added the elders and when the chorister, Sister Patterson, returned, she joined us.  We practiced together, the Elders and Sister Patterson singing the soprano and Pres. Stone singing a harmonizing part consisting of a combination of alto and tenor.  I sang the bass.  It was finally suggested that Sister Patterson's sister, Annette Bayne, join us.  She sang alto pretty well.  With no further practice we went to Abbeville.  Pres. Stone was to give the talk, Martin Smith the obituary, Bro. Yingling the first prayer and Elder Hunter the closing prayer.  Bro. Carnell dedicated the grave.  I was to conduct the service.  The house was full, but most were hostile to the church and some were just curious.  Our service was short but went off smoothly.  We thought we were going to have to sing without an accompanist as Vida declared she would not attempt to play the electronic organ.  We could find no one else to play.  When the time came to commence our service Vida walked to the organ and played like an old veteran.

	The service went off smoothly and about the only comment in the local paper was that the music was beautiful.  Since then they have held two or three funeral services.

	Each month, along with the responsibilities of the branch, we tried to visit all members who were active or who wished to be visited, once or twice a month.  This required a lot of travel as the branch was sixty-five or seventy miles long.  This was beside attending the district and zone conferences which were each held every other month.

	One day just before Christmas Bro. Carnell and I called on an old lady, Sister May.  We found her in tears and very discouraged.  She had no food in the house and no fuel except a little damp wood.  We told her that the Lord would provide.  She said He had never failed her yet.  We told her the Lord had heard her prayers and she should have both fuel and food.  Vida and I bought her groceries to last for a day or two.  That evening the Relief Society president asked the branch president for welfare money to buy groceries and fuel for her.  The president said he had only eighteen dollars and was keeping that for an emergency.  She tried to impress on him the fact that this was an emergency.  They finally decided to give Sister May the benefit of the eighteen dollars in groceries and coal.  Bro. Carnell and I bought the coal and took it to her and Vida and Sister Carnell took the groceries to her for which she was most grateful.

	In February the branch was reorganized.  The president and Vida and I tried to visit all the families in the branch every two weeks which helped to keep a good spirit among the members.  As we visited we saw the power of the Lord manifested many times.

	Sister Turner was caring for an elderly man who was almost helpless.  One day she asked me to give him a blessing.  I did as she requested according to their faith.  A month later as we called we found him sitting out in the yard under the trees.  She said he could dress and care for himself and he walked out in the yard every day.

	Another time as we approached Sister Turner's place, I told Vida, "Sister Turner is looking for us, she has asked the Lord to send us to her."  As we approached the house we saw her sitting at the window.  She came out all stooped over.  She said, "I knew you would come, I asked the Lord to send you here.  I hurt my back and would like a blessing."  I gave her the blessing through the authority of the priesthood.  As we left the house, she followed us to the car and said, "See, I can stand up straight already."  She had been healed.

	Bro. Patterson asked us one day after Sunday School for a blessing.  His legs were paining him and causing him trouble.  We administered to him and he had no more trouble with his legs as far as we knew.

	Martin Smith had an operation performed on his back just before we reached the mission field.  He began to have serious trouble with it again and asked us for a blessing after church one Sunday.  We gave him the blessing according to his faith.  Two days later we went out into the woods to an M.I.A. party.  I saw Martin Smith playing football with the boys.  I called and asked how his back was.  He answered, "I had forgotten all about it."   	        	                                              
	Ralph Yingling had a problem.  He was having difficulty managing his affairs and asked me to give him a blessing that he might prove more effective and have better judgment in his work and responsibilities.  Although this was a little unusual, I thought if he had the faith the Lord would recognize it, so blessed accordingly.  Two weeks later he came and asked for another blessing.  I asked him what his trouble was.  He said he had realized the other blessing beyond his hopes.  Now he wanted to be blessed that he might be able to express himself before an audience and tell the things that were in his heart.  We again blessed him according to his faith.  I have since heard that he has become an excellent speaker.

	Sister Balchen was in the Abbeville hospital with a throat infection.  She could scarcely speak at all.  She asked Bro. Martin Smith and me for a blessing.  We administered to her with the authority of the priesthood.  A short time later her husband came to see her.  She began talking to him in her natural voice.  He asked, rather surprised, "What has happened?  You can talk!"  She told him of the blessing, and was soon home with her family.

	Pres. Evanson called us one day and said he had a very unusual job for us.  He wanted us to contact a Mr. Kessler, recently from Iowa, and ask if his daughter Ann was pregnant.  He warned us that this man was very radical and to be careful in our approach, but that a young elder's membership depended upon the answer we received.  This made us a little nervous, so we fasted a day and prayed for the Lord's help.  When we approached the Kessler home, he opened the door and invited us in.  We stated our mission.  He told us his daughter Ann had been a great disappointment to them.  As far as they knew she was not pregnant.  No one could have been more kind and considerate than he was to us.  The Lord truly prepared the way.  We truly learned to love the people of the Greenwood branch and look forward to meeting them again.

	One more item of interest.  Our landlady and her daughter had a little dog called Teetsy.  She was so fat that she had a stroke and after several days of doctoring by the vet, and their own nursing, it became necessary to have her put to sleep.  Many tears were shed by the two ladies.  Mrs. Davis bought a nice oak casket and lined it with baby blankets, and after a period of mourning, they closed the casket and she and I carried it on some linen strips to a grave which they had a colored man dig in the back lawn.  We lowered it into the grave and I filled it and it was covered with plastic until spring.  While we were out to dinner with them shortly before leaving Greenwood they expressed their regrets to me that they had not asked me to give a short talk at the grave side.  Since it was safely past I told them I would have been happy to have done so.

	Vida was often turned around in that area and as the roads were sometimes a little confusing she would sometimes get on the wrong road.  Perhaps I directed her a little too often which irritated her.  One day we were returning to our apartment, Vida was driving, and passed the road where we should have turned off the main road.  I said nothing.  She finally recognized where she was and said, "What am I doing here?"  I said, "I wondered the same thing."  I guess it was the wrong thing to say, as she stopped the car in the road and got out.  I moved over in the driver's seat without looking around.  I heard the back door open and shut, and started the car.  I drove down a side road for a quarter to a half mile and decided it was too far around that way so turned around and went back the way I had come.  I saw a white woman walking up the road at a rather fast rate.  I was surprised as we usually saw no one but colored people on that road.  As I drew near she began to look familiar.  I looked around in the back seat and there was no one there.  It was a little embarrassing for both of us, but both saw the humor in it.  I never lost her again.

	Before leaving Greenwood, which we did on the 26th of September, the branch gave us a party and thirty-two dollars to help us on our way home.  There were many tearful good-byes as we made our final rounds among the people and spoke for the last time in their services.  They became very close to us and we try to keep in touch with them, hoping to return to visit them some day.

	We left Greenwood Monday morning, the 26th of September 1966, and came by way of Ashville, North Carolina and spent our first night at Nashville, Tennessee.  It rained most of the day so it was miserable traveling.  The following day we drove through Kentucky and saw the beautiful bluegrass country.  We reached Louisville in the late afternoon.  We had considerable trouble finding the bridge across the Ohio River and more trouble finding our freeway to Indianapolis.  

	 We stopped that night at a small city called Columbia, Indiana, at an Imperial 400 Motel.  The next day we drove through the edge of Indianapolis and on through Springfield, Illinois to Carthage, where we stopped at the old jail for a while.  Then we went on to Nauvoo where we called at the visitor's center where Bro. Gardner showed us a film and took us to a motel.  He also showed us the old homes and told us of places of interest there.  	
	The next day we traveled through Iowa and most of Nebraska where we stopped at a small town.  We left there at 4 a.m.  As we were near the Mountain Time Zone, it was almost three, so we were at the Wyoming border by daylight.  We wanted to reach Ogden so we could attend the Saturday sessions of General Conference, as Barbara, Dean, and family were there.  We made good time and drove into Marge's a little after sundown, where Barbara and children came to see us.  It was surely a happy reunion.  We attended the Saturday and Sunday sessions of Conference and Monday afternoon drove to Preston where we stopped at Leonard's for a few minutes and then to Thora McBride's where we spent the night.  Emma was away so we didn't get to see her.  

	We came on home and after a little phoning got hold of Bishop Hammond and got a key to the house and started housekeeping.  Irven, Bernice, Lee, Wilma, Floyd, and Marge had cleaned up the house so it was ready to go.  This was surely appreciated, as the place was in poor condition after the renters left, and we were tired from our long trip.                                 

	Two weeks after our return we gave our reports in Sacrament Meeting.  We were given the entire time.

	We spent a little time at home getting things in shape, then took off for Boise, Pasco, Castro Valley and Victorville, where we visited all the children before preparing to go back to the temple.

	Since we had been released by Pres. Kilpack, we had to be approved again by the General Authorities and approved by the bishop and stake president, which took until the latter part of November.  It was good to be back to the temple, where we had so many friends to greet us.

	We also received an invitation to speak in Victor, which we filled after our trip to the coast.  I also spoke in the Idaho Falls 26th Ward and at a fireside.

	About this time Sister Kearsley passed away and I was asked to speak at her funeral.  I also spoke at the funeral service of Sister Alma Hansen, here in our ward building.

	Christmas was made a happy time by Mark, Barbara, and families coming to spend it with us.                                       
	We were busy in the spring fixing up our yard.  I built a fence along the lower end and we planted a small garden and quite a number of flowers.

	Vida was sustained a teacher in the Relief Society and I was given the position of assistant secretary to the Senior Aaronic Priesthood, which I held for two years, when I was made secretary.

	The next fall we went to General Conference where we met Barbara and Dean and also Bo Patterson, from Greenwood.  Those were happy reunions.  We stayed at Marge's.  We also attended the Southern States missionary reunion, where we met a number of our faithful friends and fellow missionaries. 

	 The summer passed as usual.  We tried to improve the yards and make the place look better.  We also did a little fishing and visiting.  The following spring Emma Callan passed away at Preston.  We joined the family there for the funeral services.

	The next summer we joined three other couples of temple workers and joined in a number of dinners and picnics together.  This started a little romance.  Bro. Porter, who had lost his wife, became interested in Sister Saxton, who had lost her husband.  They were married around the first of September.

	In January I took ill and was in the hospital about two weeks.  It was only after changing doctors, and a lot of test and x-rays that they found an accumulation of gallstones.  Dr. Higgs performed the surgery.  I was away from the temple about six weeks.

	In March we went to Victorville on the train to be with Barbara and help her when her baby girl was born.  She was named Andrea.  After two weeks Mark came for us to go and stay with his children, as Pat was going to a hospital with "nervous breakdown," or at least she called it that.  After a hurried trip home and back by plane, we stayed and took care of the children for a month, until Mark had his divorce from Pat, when we came back home in May.

	We attended General Conference in April.

	I was away from the temple about six weeks and in a few months was fully recovered.

	In the fall of 1969 Vida again went to Victorville to help Barbara when her last baby was born.  He was a boy whom they named Leslie.  She had been gone but two or three days when I became ill with some kind of arthritis.  I had an extreme pain in the left shoulder.  It came on very suddenly.  I called the Hammond home but no one was there.  It was with great difficulty I could even get out of bed.  I called the Woods but no one answered.  There was a knock at the door, but I was so long getting out of bed that they were gone before I could reach it.  I happened to see the Relief Society teachers going by the window.  I opened the door and called to them.  It was Sister  Wood and Sister Miles.  I asked Sister Wood to ask Brother Wood to come over.  She went home and forgot it until late that evening.  I was in such pain I could hardly endure it.  I finally succeeded in contacting Dr. Higgs.  He told me to put a wet towel on my shoulder, cover it with plastic, then put the hot pad on it.  I did this for about two hours and almost scalded it but it reduced the pain.  I finally called Bishop Hammond, and he and Sister Hammond came right over.  They did all they could to make me comfortable and told me to leave the door unlocked and turn the light on if I needed them.  I rested better that night.  The next day I called Barbara and Vida.  Barbara wired me a plane ticket.  Two days later, although real lame and sore, I took the plane for California and was soon with Vida and Barbara and family.  We stayed there until Conference time and came to Salt Lake City with them when they came to Conference.

     Christmas of 1969 we spent with Mark and Ruth's family.  Barbara, Dean and family came and spent a few days with us.  We went from Ogden to Oakland and back on the plane.  

	1970 was our golden year, but all wasn't gold that year.  Not much of interest happened until early summer when we began making preparations for our golden wedding anniversary.  Barbara was the promoter of the whole affair.  All went well until three or four days before the reception, which was held at the Fourth Ward recreation hall.  I was hit in the night by prostate gland trouble.  I suffered it out until the next day when I called to the doctor and he sent me to the hospital where they inserted a catheter and drained me and sent me home.  Later in the day I found myself in the same condition and saw the doctor and told him of our golden wedding reception two evenings later and he sent me back to the hospital and told them to leave the catheter in.  He told me he would fix me up so I could go to the reception, but I would have to go to the hospital the next day for surgery.  So I went home but was not in a condition to take much part in the preparations for the reception.  It was held the evening of the 25th as the 26th was Sunday.

	All our children came and a number of the grandchildren.  There was a pretty good attendance of friends and relatives.
Parts of it were rather neglected so many went home without refreshments.

	The three boys and Greg sang "God Bless Our Mountain Home," with Barbara at the piano.  Roark played my special number, "Heart Tones."  Tammy sang.  Michael showed some pictures--scenes of our family life.  Bill conducted the program.

	Four of our granddaughters presented Vida with a large bouquet of roses, after which Bill called on me for a few remarks, which I insert as near as I can remember them.  I didn't feel at all well and almost felt this would be the last time I would meet with all of them.

	Some of the children and their families left the next day.  I went to the hospital Sunday and Dr. Sawyer was called to perform the surgery, which was performed Tuesday or Wednesday.  It was a very difficult ordeal for me.  The prostate was malignant.  A large, hard growth or lump had formed near my collarbone.  Scrapings from it showed that it was also malignant.  I was given an estrogen pill every day for the prostate malignancy and the lump soon began to disappear and was soon entirely gone.

	I had received a blessing at the hands of the Elders so my recovery was rapid and complete.  The doctor had been very concerned about the lump and after it was gone he asked me who got the credit, the doctor or the blessing.  I told him both, as we always asked for a blessing upon the doctor as well as the patient, that he might perform his work well.  I didn't go back to the temple until after the fall vacation, around the first of November.  We spent the Christmas holidays at Boise, with Bill and family.

	I have done considerable fishing in the summertime.  We used to travel considerable distances at times to catch a few fish.  I usually went with Brothers Wood and Morgan, two very good friends.

	Each year we have gone to the campground on Piney Pass, near Victor, with our little group of temple workers, the Smiths, Porters, and Fullmers, for breakfast.  It was always a very pleasant experience.  We also had our little get-togethers in our homes where we had dinner or refreshments and just visited.  All are temple officiators.

	The Christmas of 1971 we spent at Victorville with Barbara, Dean and family.  We enjoyed our visit there.  Mark, Ruth, and family came and took us to Sacramento, where Mark had set up his practice.  We spent about ten days there then flew home.

	In April I had another gallstone attack.  I was admitted to the hospital with a bad case of jaundice.  I was released after two weeks, feeling much better.  I returned to the hospital again in July but only stayed about four days.  I was given antibiotics for about two months and continued to improve and have felt much better since.  

	In June we went to Pasco to visit Duane and family.  We attended Roark's testimonial before leaving for his mission to Germany.  Greg left for his mission to Canada the first part of June.

	We spent the Christmas of 1972 at Irven's in Pocatello and most of the holidays at home.  In the first of September the temple closed for remodeling.  So we have had a lot of leave time during the past year.

	In April of 1973 we received a call from our Stake Presidency to work as assistant genealogical librarians and to attend classes for about two months.  We were to give one day a week, Saturdays, to this work.  We have attended the classes but so far have not been called to work there.

	In January of 1973 Vida had a very severe case of the flu.  I was alone with her but was helpless in the face of so serious an illness.  She was administered to but was too ill to be taken to the hospital in the extreme cold weather we were having.  Most of our friends were afraid to come near us.  I called Barbara, in Victorville, and told her Vida's condition.  She immediately called Bishop and Sister Hammond and told them we needed help.  They came right over and brought a vaporizer, and food and did all they could to help us.  They tried to get a doctor but none were available and the hospital was full.  They stayed all day and did all they could and were back again the next day.  We got her fever broken but she was a very sick woman for weeks.

	In March, just as she was recovering from the flu she had a heart attack which put her down for a long time.  But by me doing the heavy work she had managed to recover to almost her usual health.  Of course we went to a doctor and have used the medication he prescribed.  With the blessing of the Lord she has made an almost complete recovery.

	In the latter part of June, Michael, Tricia and children came and spent a couple of days with us, which we enjoyed very much.

	In early July our children and some of their families came to see us.  Barbara and all but one of her children arrived first, then Mark, Ruth and her two children.  We went up above  Victor to the Mike Harris campground to spend a night or two.  Duane, Joy, Mitzi and Bill and Heather and April joined us there.  We camped and fished and visited together.  We came home for a night or two.  Mark, Ruth and family and Duane and his family left after one night at home.  An evil spirit crept in among us and there were some rather ill feelings among some before they left.  This was rather a surprise to some of us after the very pleasant home evening we had just experienced.  Duane and Joy cut their visit short just to get away.  It left us with very heavy hearts as this was perhaps the last time we would all be together here.  Late Thursday evening Betty, Barry, Tam and Judy came.  We went back up to the Mike Harris campground and did some more fishing and camped overnight.  Barbara and children had left for home the night before.

	Vida's brother and sisters and their families were meeting to hold their family reunion.  While Bill and family had to leave for home, Vida and I stayed over Saturday night and attended the reunion, which turned out pretty well.

	Sunday morning we came home.  Vida was tired out.  She slept almost continuously for three days and nights and felt much better.

	We have since attended the Hill family reunion at Wellsville, Utah.  We also visited the Martin Smith family, our friend from South Carolina, and Martin's mother, Sister Edith Smith, a very dear friend.  We have also attended the Crandall family reunion held here in Idaho Falls on the 21 of July.

	Not much ahead for the rest of the summer until the temple opens, which we hope will be in about six weeks.
